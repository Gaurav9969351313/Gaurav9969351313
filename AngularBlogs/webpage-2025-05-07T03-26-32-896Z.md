Hiring or prepping for an Angular role in 2025? The framework has evolved, and so have the expectations. Here are **20 essential questions** (with simple, human answers) to gauge expertise in modern Angular development.

# Core Concepts

1.  **What are Angular Signals, and how do they differ from RxJS Observables?**

**Answer**: Signals are reactive primitives that track state changes efficiently. Unlike Observables (which handle async streams), Signals simplify synchronous state management. Use Signals for local component state and Observables for complex async operations like HTTP calls.

**2\. Explain standalone components. Why replace NgModules?**

**Answer**: Standalone components are self-contained, eliminating the need for NgModules. They reduce boilerplate, simplify lazy loading, and make apps more modular. Angular 17+ defaults to standalone, streamlining app architecture.

**3\. How does hydration improve SSR in Angular?**

**Answer**: Hydration prevents flickering by reusing server-rendered HTML in the browser instead of re-rendering. Angular 19â€™s enhanced hydration reduces load times and improves SEO by making SSR smoother.

# Advanced Features

**4\. What is zoneless change detection?**

**Answer**: Zoneless mode (introduced in Angular 18+) removes dependency on `zone.js`, reducing bundle size and improving performance. It uses signals or manual triggers to detect changes, giving developers finer control.

**5\. How would you optimize Angular app performance?**

**Answer**:

-   Use `OnPush` change detection.
-   Lazy load standalone components.
-   Analyze bundles with `source-map-explorer`.
-   Enable SSR hydration and caching.

**6\. Whatâ€™s an interceptor? Give an example.**

-   **Answer**: Interceptors modify HTTP requests/responses. Example: Adding a JWT token to headers.

@Injectable()    
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {    
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any\>, next: HttpHandler) {    
    const cloned = req.clone({ setHeaders: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' } });    
    return next.handle(cloned);    
  }    
}  

# State Management

**7\. NgRx vs. Signals for state: When to use each?**

**Answer**: Use **NgRx** for complex global state (e.g., multi-step workflows). Use **Signals** for local state or simple apps. Signals are lightweight and integrated into Angularâ€™s reactivity model.

**8\. How do you prevent memory leaks?**

**Answer**:

-   Unsubscribe from Observables (or use `takeUntilDestroyed`).
-   Avoid manual DOM manipulations.
-   Use Angularâ€™s `async` pipe in templates.

# Security & Testing

**9\. How secure Angular apps against XSS?**

**Answer**:

-   Sanitize user input with `DomSanitizer`.
-   Avoid `innerHTML` with untrusted data.
-   Use CSP headers and sanitize third-party libraries.

**10\. Whatâ€™s your testing strategy?**

**Answer**:

-   **Unit tests**: Test components/services in isolation (Jest).
-   **Integration tests**: Validate component interactions.
-   **E2E tests**: Use Cypress for user flow testing.

# Modern Patterns

**11\. How to lazy load standalone components?**

**Answer**: Use `loadComponent` in the router:

{ path: 'dashboard', loadComponent: () => import('./dashboard.component') }  

**12\. Design a dynamic form with validation.**

**Answer**: Use reactive forms with `FormBuilder`:

this.form = this.fb.group({    
  email: \['', \[Validators.required, Validators.email\]\],    
  password: \['', \[Validators.minLength(8)\]\]    
});  

# Debugging & Tools

**13\. Debug a memory leak. Steps?**

**Answer**:

-   Use Chrome DevToolsâ€™ Memory tab.
-   Look for detached DOM nodes or orphaned subscriptions.
-   Audit components with `ng.profiler.timeChangeDetection()`.

**14\. Whatâ€™s Angularâ€™s new control flow syntax?**

**Answer**: Replace `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` with `@if` and `@for`:

@if (user.isAdmin) {    
  <button\>Delete</button\>    
}  

# Future-Forward Skills

**15\. Integrate WebSockets in Angular.**

**Answer**: Use RxJSâ€™s `webSocket`:

import { webSocket } from 'rxjs/webSocket';    
const socket$ = webSocket('ws://localhost:8080');    
socket$.subscribe((data) => console.log(data));  

**16\. Whatâ€™s exciting in Angular 19?**

**Answer**: Stable signals, partial hydration for faster SSR, and DevTools improvements for debugging reactivity.

# Architecture

**17\. Implement micro-frontends with Angular.**

**Answer**: Use Module Federation (via Nx or Webpack) to split the app into independently deployable modules.

**18\. Structure a large-scale app.**

**Answer**:

-   Group features by domain (e.g., `auth`, `dashboard`).
-   Use standalone components and lazy loading.
-   Centralize state with Signals or NgRx.

# Final Questions

**19\. Upgrade Angular from v14 to v19?**

**Answer**:

-   Incrementally update one major version at a time.
-   Use `ng update` and fix breaking changes.
-   Migrate to standalone components and signals.

**20\. Why choose Angular over other frameworks?**

**Answer**: Angular offers a full-stack solution with built-in tools (RxJS, SSR, CLI), enterprise-grade scalability, and a strong ecosystem.

# Key Takeaways

-   **Signals** simplify reactivity.
-   **Standalone components** reduce complexity.
-   **Hydration** and **SSR** boost performance.
