You probably already have come across the three directives _ng-content_, _ng-container_ and _ng-template_, but a short reminder can be of help. Especially if you are preparing for an Angular interview.

# ng-content

_ng-content_ is used to project content into Angular components. In plain HTML, you can create children in any element, like this:

<iframe src="https://codeburst.io/media/420d4341b36da7778801a38392808afe" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="190" width="680" title="parent-child.html" class="eo n hi dz bg" scrolling="no"></iframe>

If instead of _divs_ you do something similar with Angular components, your child _div_ won’t be displayed... except if you tell Angular where to display it in the parent template using _ng-content_.

<iframe src="https://codeburst.io/media/72926f759287d8fb482560821995457c" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" width="680" title="content-projection" class="eo n hi dz bg" scrolling="no"></iframe>

This example would render this:

You can even differentiate between children and display them in different places in the parent component using the _select_ attribute:

The two _divs_ are rendered where they are selected. We select over the class here, but you can use any CSS selector. It would render this way:

# ng-container

_ng-container_ is an extremely simple directive that allows you to group elements in a template but doesn’t itself get rendered in the DOM (but what it contains does). It just becomes a comment:

It is especially helpful when you want to apply two structural directives to the same element. As you might know, you can’t write anything like this:

You may only apply one structural directive to an element, so whether _\*ngIf_ or _\*ngFor_ but not both. You could add a _div_ or a _span_ in between to apply the second directive to, but in our case we would have empty _li_ or invalid HTML.

On the other hand, if you replace the _span_ in the previous example with a _ng-container_ you can apply your two structural directives and keep your HTML valid: _the ng-container_ is not rendered in the DOM.

# ng-template

_ng-template_ is used to render HTML in a template but is never rendered directly. If you add a _ng-template_ tag to your template, it and everything inside it will be replaced by a comment.

It might seem a bit useless, but it is rarely used alone. It can be for example used to define the _else_ case of an _\*ngIf._

You can create a reference to your _ng-template_ and use it in the _else_ clause. It can also be used with _ng-switch_ and your can reference it in your TypeScript code to do whatever you want with it.

To sum up, _ng-content_ is used to display children in a template, _ng-container_ is used as a non-rendered container to avoid having to add a _span_ or a _div_, and _ng-template_ allows you to group some content that is not rendered directly but can be used in other places of your template or you code.
