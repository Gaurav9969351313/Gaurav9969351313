Welcome to **Day 7** of the Angular Interview Q&A series! Today, we‚Äôll dive into some deeper Angular topics that are often asked in senior-level interviews and real-world projects.

# Question 1: What are Signals in Angular (v16+) and how do they work?

**Answer:**

**Signals** are a new reactive primitive in Angular (v16+) that allow for fine-grained reactivity without the need for observables.

They automatically track dependencies and re-evaluate when values change, similar to `useState()` in React or signals in Solid.js.

**Example:**

import { signal, computed } from '@angular/core';  
  
const count = signal(0);  
const doubleCount = computed(() => count() \* 2);  
count.set(5);  
console.log(doubleCount()); // Output: 10

> _‚úÖ Signals are ideal for component-local state and template reactivity._

# Question 2: What is the Angular lifecycle sequence of a component?

**Answer:**

Here‚Äôs the lifecycle hook order for an Angular component:

1.  `ngOnChanges()` ‚Äì called when input properties change.
2.  `ngOnInit()` ‚Äì called once after the first `ngOnChanges`.
3.  `ngDoCheck()` ‚Äì called during every change detection run.
4.  `ngAfterContentInit()` ‚Äì after content projected via `<ng-content>`.
5.  `ngAfterContentChecked()` ‚Äì after every check of projected content.
6.  `ngAfterViewInit()` ‚Äì after the component's view and child views are initialized.
7.  `ngAfterViewChecked()` ‚Äì after the view and child views have been checked.
8.  `ngOnDestroy()` ‚Äì just before the component is destroyed.

# Question 3: What is the role of `ChangeDetectorRef` in Angular?

**Answer:**

`ChangeDetectorRef` is used to manually trigger change detection or detach a component from the Angular change detection tree.

**Common use cases:**

-   Optimizing performance in large apps.
-   Controlling when to update the view (e.g., inside `setTimeout` or `WebSocket` callbacks).

**Example:**

constructor(private cdRef: ChangeDetectorRef) {}  
  
ngAfterViewInit() {  
  setTimeout(() => {  
    this.data = 'Updated!';  
    this.cdRef.detectChanges(); // manually trigger change detection  
  }, 1000);  
}

# Question 4: How does state management work in Angular?

**Answer:**

There are multiple ways to manage state in Angular:

-   **Service-based local state** (simpler apps)
-   **BehaviorSubject + RxJS** for shared state
-   **NgRx** (Redux-style global store)
-   **Signals** for localized component state (v16+)

**Example (RxJS service-based state):**

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })  
export class CounterService {  
  private count = new BehaviorSubject(0);  
  count$ = this.count.asObservable();  
  
increment() {  
    this.count.next(this.count.value + 1);  
  }  
}  

# Question 5: What are the best practices for Angular performance tuning?

**Answer:**

Here are some real-world performance tips:

-   Use **OnPush** change detection strategy.
-   Avoid unnecessary bindings and heavy operations in templates.
-   Use **trackBy** with `*ngFor`.
-   Lazy load modules and components.
-   Avoid memory leaks by unsubscribing observables.
-   Prefer **Signals** for lightweight reactivity.
-   Use standalone components to reduce NgModule complexity (Angular 14+).
