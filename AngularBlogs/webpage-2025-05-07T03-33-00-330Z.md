# 31\. How do you create reusable components in Angular?

## Approach:

-   Design components that are highly reusable and configurable using `@Input` and `@Output` decorators.
-   Separate concerns and avoid hardcoding values.

## Code Example:

@Component({  
  selector: 'app-button',  
  template: \`<button (click)="onClick.emit()">{{ label }}</button>\`  
})  
export class ButtonComponent {  
  @Input() label: string = '';  
  @Output() onClick = new EventEmitter<void\>();  
}

## Output:

Reusing the `ButtonComponent` with different labels and click behaviors in multiple parts of the application.

# 32\. What is the role of HTTP interceptors in Angular?

## Approach:

-   Use HTTP interceptors to modify HTTP requests and responses globally.
-   Implement common tasks such as adding authentication headers or logging.

## Code Example:

@Injectable()  
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {  
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any\>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any\>> {  
    const cloned = req.clone({  
      setHeaders: { Authorization: \`Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}\` }  
    });  
    return next.handle(cloned);  
  }  
}

## Output:

Global handling of HTTP requests simplifies authentication and logging workflows.

# 33\. How do you test Angular components effectively?

## Approach:

-   Use the Angular TestBed to configure and initialize the testing environment.
-   Write unit tests for component methods and DOM interactions using Jasmine and Karma.

## Code Example:

describe('AppComponent', () => {  
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<AppComponent\>;  
  let component: AppComponent;

  beforeEach(async () => {  
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({  
      declarations: \[AppComponent\]  
    }).compileComponents();  
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);  
    component = fixture.componentInstance;  
  });  it('should create the app', () => {  
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();  
  });  
});

## Output:

Enhanced reliability and reduced regressions through well-structured tests.

# 34\. Explain how lazy loading works in Angular.

## Approach:

-   Use the `loadChildren` property in the route configuration.
-   Load modules on-demand instead of at the application startup.

## Code Example:

const routes: Routes = \[  
  { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }  
\];

## Output:

Improved application performance by reducing the initial load time.

# 35\. How do you implement reactive forms in Angular?

## Approach:

-   Leverage the `FormBuilder` service to define form controls and validation logic.
-   Use `formGroup` and `formControlName` in the template for two-way binding.

## Code Example:

constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {  
  this.form = this.fb.group({  
    name: \['', Validators.required\],  
    age: \['', Validators.min(18)\]  
  });  
}

onSubmit() {  
  console.log(this.form.value);  
}

## Output:

Efficiently managing forms with complex validation logic.

# 36\. What is Angular Universal, and how does it improve SEO?

## Approach:

-   Use Angular Universal for server-side rendering (SSR) to improve page load speed and SEO.
-   Discuss how search engines can index pre-rendered HTML content.

## Output:

Enhanced SEO and faster first contentful paint for Angular applications.

# 37\. How do you secure Angular applications against XSS and CSRF?

## Approach:

-   Use Angularâ€™s built-in DOM sanitization mechanisms to prevent XSS.
-   Implement CSRF tokens in HTTP requests for server communication.

## Code Example:

@ViewChild('content', { static: true })  
private content: ElementRef;

ngAfterViewInit() {  
  this.sanitizedContent = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(this.content.nativeElement.innerHTML);  
}

## Output:

Improved application security by preventing malicious attacks.

# 38\. What is differential loading in Angular?

## Approach:

-   Explain how Angular CLI generates separate bundles for modern and legacy browsers.
-   Discuss the advantages of smaller bundles and faster load times.

## Output:

Optimized application performance for modern browsers while maintaining compatibility with older ones.

# 39\. How do you use custom directives in Angular?

## Approach:

-   Define directives to encapsulate reusable behaviors.
-   Discuss structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and attribute directives.

## Code Example:

@Directive({ selector: '\[appHighlight\]' })  
export class HighlightDirective {  
  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {  
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';  
  }

  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}  
}

## Output:

Added dynamic behaviors to elements using directives.

# 40\. What is the role of Web Workers in Angular applications?

## Approach:

-   Discuss the benefits of offloading CPU-intensive tasks to Web Workers.
-   Use the Angular CLI to generate and integrate a Web Worker.

## Output:

Improved application responsiveness by running tasks in a separate thread.
