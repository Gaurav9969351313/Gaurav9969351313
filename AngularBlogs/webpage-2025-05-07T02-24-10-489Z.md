Unlike strongly typed languages like Java, C, C++ sometimes JavasScript doesn’t behave the way we expect it to be. Consider below example

console.log(“colour is”, colour);var colour;

The usual expectation here would be **Reference error** as we are trying to access a variable before it is being defined. But the actual output is

colour is undefined

You would be wondering how is this possible ? before explaining that consider below code snippet with slight modification.

console.log(“colour is”, colour);let colour;

Because of above explanation one would expect output should be **colour is** **undefined,** here as well. But the output would be **reference error,** if we use the **const** instead of **let** we will get runtime error. Same variable, because of the declaring process, how the answer is getting altered ?

# **Hoisting**

**“Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top.”** One can relate it with flag hosting, where flag will be hoisted to the top of the pole.

**In simple words in JavaScript all the variables that are declared with let, var or const will hoisted or declared at the top of the block during the compilation.** Only for those variables created with **var** keyword the default value will be set to **undefined**. So after compilation above code looks like below.

var color = undefined; // _this is just indicatory_  
console.log(“colour is”, colour);  
var colour;let colour; // **Since there is no default value we will get reference error (**_this line is just indicatory_**)**  
console.log(“colour is”, colour);  
let colour;**// Here we get run time error, because when you declare a variable with const it must have a default value. We cannot create a const variable without initial value.**  
console.log(“colour is”, colour);  
const colour;//**Even in this case we get run time error as we are trying to access const variable before it is defined.** console.log(“colour is”, colour);  
const colour = "red";

Note: **Important thing to observe** here is JavaScript compiler doesn’t just hoist variables declared with **var** keyword, **it will hoist variables created with let and const also**. Just Because the variables are not initialised with default value we get **reference error in case of let** and **runtime error in case of const**.

A snippets for practice

var rate = 10function getRate() {  if (rate == undefined) {      var rate = 6;      return rate;   } else {      return 10;   }}console.log("Rate is", getRate());

**Most of you think output as _Rate is 10_; But answer would be Rate is 6.** Because in the **getRate** function inside if condition, there is a variable named **rate** declared with **var** keyword. During compilation the rate variable will be hoisted to the top of the **getRate()** method with default value as undefined. So during runtime the **rate == undefined will be set to true and** value returned will be 6.

# **How to avoid above scenarios ?**

If your in an interview and you cracked above puzzle, next question interviewer will ask you is, how to resolve this problem. Simplest way to solve is use **let** instead of **var** inside the function.

var rate = 10function getRate() {if (rate == undefined) {let rate = 6;return rate;} else {return 10;}}console.log("Rate is", getRate());

**Try different combinations with let, const and var. All the best for your learning!!**
