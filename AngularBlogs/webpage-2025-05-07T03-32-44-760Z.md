1.  **BehaviorSubject:** Special Subject that holds current value and emits to new subscribers.  
    **2\. Subject:** Multicast Observable, emits to multiple subscribers.  
    **3\. @Input:** Decorator to pass data from parent to child component.  
    **4\. @Output:** Decorator to emit data from child to parent component.  
    **5\. @EventEmitter:** Emits custom events to parent components.  
    **6\. Loading:** Shows progress/spinner while data is being fetched.  
    **7\. Decorator:** A function to modify class/variable behavior.  
    **8\. Directive:** Custom behavior applied to elements (structural/attribute).  
    **9\. Service:** Shared logic across components using dependency injection.  
    **10\. Pipe:** Transforms output in templates (e.g., date, currency).  
    **11\. Guard:** Protects routes based on conditions (AuthGuard).  
    **12\. Provider:** Supplies services/instances to Angular modules/components.  
    **13\. Module:** Logical group of components, directives, and services.  
    **14\. Interceptor:** Intercepts and modifies HTTP requests/responses.  
    **15\. Wild Card Route:** Handles undefined routes using \`\*\*\`.  
    **16\. Promise & Async:** Handles async operations, resolves single value.  
    **17\. Subject Type:** BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject, AsyncSubject, etc.  
    **18\. Binding:** Connects template and component data (e.g., one-way, two-way).  
    **19\. HttpClient:** Angular service to make HTTP requests.  
    **20\. HttpInterceptor:** Intercepts and modifies HTTP requests globally.  
    **21\. Observables:** Streams of data, can emit multiple values over time.  
    **22\. Form:** Handles user input using reactive or template-driven forms.  
    **23\. LifeCycle Hooks:** Methods triggered at different component lifecycle stages (ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy).  
    **24\. Dependency Injection:** Design pattern to inject services into components.  
    **25\. Singleton:** A single instance of a service throughout the app.  
    **26\. ViewContainerRef:** Accesses and manipulates views dynamically.  
    **27\. Basics of Observables and Observers:** Observables emit data; Observers consume it.  
    **28\. Common RxJS Operators:** Transform streams (map, filter, mergeMap, switchMap).  
    **29\. Difference: Promise vs Observable:** Promise resolves once; Observable streams multiple values.
