# 11\. Why we use pipe operators in RXJS. What is the use of it?

pipe method help to combine multiple operators together and transform them into a single item.

Example:

of(17,27,32).pipe(  
 map(x => x + 1),  
 filter(x => x > 18)  
);

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 12\. What is the difference between using the Async pipe vs the subscribe function in the Angular application?

If you are using modern techniques, you mostly deal with Async pipe which does have certain benefits such as unsubscribe by itself or OnPush support.

**Let’s check the difference between Async and Subscribe operator.**

# 13\. What is the difference between promise and observable?

It looks the same right because if you come JavaScript background you mostly use promises. Which one is best from the promise and observable?

**Let’s check out the difference between promise and observable.**

# 14\. What is the difference between Event Emitter and Subjects?

If I get this question I mostly go with event emitter is used while communicating child to parent component but why it is preferred over the subject?

**Let’s check out the difference between them.**

# 15\. What is the difference between Observable and Subject?

**Alert! Hot favorite question from the interviewer to check out your knowledge about the observables.**

**_Let’s understand the difference between Observable and Subject._**

# 16\. What is the difference between Activated Route vs Activated route Snapshot?

The major difference between Activated Route vs Activated Route Snapshot is with Activated Route we can subscribe to Observable while Activated Route Snapshot only emits one value.

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 17\. Discuss a different kind of loading strategies used in your Angular application

This kind of question asked to check how deep you have used angular. Most of the times we answer lazy loading and eager loading but there is one more in the list which we should consider….

## Eager Loading

The components under eager loading get loaded before the application starts.

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/ang-eager-loading-example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ang-eager-loading-example)

## Lazy Loading

The components under lazy loading will be loaded only when needed. It helps to improve the performance and helps to start the application faster.

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular6-lazy-loading](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular6-lazy-loading)

## Pre-Loading

The components get loaded after the application starts.

# 18\. What is Metadata?

Seems new word for me in Angular. No, you use it daily but never know the exact name. Let’s check this out…

> _“It is used to decorate the class to get the different behaviour from the class._

Below are the examples of metadata used in Angular.

1.  **_Class Decorator_** — @component
2.  **_Property Decorator_** — @Input
3.  **_Method Decorator_** — @HostListner
4.  **_Parameter Decorator_** — @Inject

# 19\. What is routerlinkActive use for?

Are you using navbar in your angular application? If so this one is one of the common directives to show the activated item.

It checks to activate Router Link based on the current RouterState.

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 20\. Where we use generics in Angular?

This is one of the latest interview questions in Angular. Interviewers want to check how well you are writing clean by typecasting objects or specific Observable or Events.

There are different places where we commonly use generics.

1.  **_While defining emitters_**

Output() click : EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>()

2\. **_While capturing the response from observable_**

data: Observable<IResponse>

3. **_Defining Interfaces_**

interface Item {  
info:string,  
…  
}  
Input public items: Item\[\]
