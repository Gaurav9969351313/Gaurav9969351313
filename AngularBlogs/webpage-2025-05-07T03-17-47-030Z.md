Recently, I was trying to prepare myself for upcoming interviews and it was a bit difficult to search in Google and open the links only to see the same questions each and every time. So, I thought of sharing what I have found and what are the most common questions someone should know if they are preparing for an interview.

Below are the most common interview questions asked in the latest Angular interviews. These Angular interview questions and answers help to prepare Angular developers for interviews ranging from junior to senior levels. Moreover, this article covers the basics to advance Angular interview questions which you must prepare in 2021.

# 21\. What is the wild card route?

One of the common use wild card route redirects to this route if someone types something which is not the proper path.

To handle this error, and instead of notifying the user, we can use **WILDCARD** routes.

**Example**:

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 22\. What is the difference between ngIf and hidden?

Isn’t it both same? both have the same function of hiding the things.No, but if you check that ngIf won’t load template if conditions get false while hidden will load the template and hide it.

**ngIf** will not load the HTML data written inside if the condition is not satisfied.

**hidden** will load the data and using **display: none** property doesn't show in the HTML

Which one is better?

If you are thinking about performance, ngIf is better as it will not load the HTML itself but if the condition is satisfied it will render DOM again.

# 23\. What is a router outlet?

We do see this tag in the main app component HTML. But what is it? Let’s understand this term.

this directive is available from the `@angular/router` package and used to mark where the component is inserted.

it is the main tag of the angular application as it will act as a shell of our application. whatever we add in the shell will be rendered in views, only the part marked by the router outlet will be changed.

For example: If you use the header in the application it will be steady and other things will change based on the components.

# 24\. What is the Router state?

In simple terms, the router state maintains the state of the routes and we can check all the states by subscribing to specific router events.

_For example:_

If we navigate from “/inbox/33/messages/44” to “/inbox/33/messages/45”, the data observable will emit a new set of data with the new message object, and the component will display Message 45.

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-routerlink-state](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-routerlink-state)

# 25\. What is an Active route?

**ActivatedRoute gives access to the URL, params, data, queryParams, and fragment observables.**

Given the following:

And navigating first to “/inbox/33/data/44” and then to “/inbox/33/data/45”, we will see:

url \[{path: ‘data’, params: {}}, {path: ‘44’, params: {}}\]  
url \[{path: ‘data’, params: {}}, {path: ‘45’, params: {}}\]

# 26\. Explain different injections in angular.

One of the common interview questions asked in angular interview questions is how you are using injections in Angular application?

There are 5 different ways we angular provide dependency injections

1.  **use class**
2.  **use value**
3.  **use factory**
4.  **token factory**
5.  **component injections**

To know more in detailed implementations, Please check the below article.

## What can you provide with Dependency Injection in Angular?

### Angular has a powerful Dependency Injection basis. We can transfer any data through our apps, transform it and replace…

**_You can check angular documentation for detailed explanations._**

# 27\. What is the best way to implement translations in angular?

In the Single Page Application, One of the main features is multi-language support on the fly. But Sometimes the interviewer asks have you implemented translations in your application?

The most common library used for this is ngx-translate which provides a translation by adding in the JSON.

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 28\. Explain different routing params in Angular.

We do use routing parameters to maintain the data or sometimes pass data when navigating from one route to another route.

Angular does support the following routing parameters.

1.  Required Parameters
2.  Optional Parameters
3.  Query Parameters
4.  NavigationExtras

# 29\. What is a virtual scroll in Angular?

Here Interviewer wants to check if you have updated knowledge of the latest angular features.

The main concept behind virtual scrolling is rendering only visible items.

For example, if there are thousands of alerts in an application, an efficient way would be to load only the elements that are visible and unload them when they are not by replacing them with new ones.

An initial implementation of virtual scrolling is now available in @angular/cdk. (v7.0.0-beta.0)

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 30\. What is the difference between route param vs query param?

The main difference between query and route param is route param is mandatory to determine the route while query param is optional.

Let’s understand some of the basics of Routing in Angular.

## Declaring Route Parameters

export const routes: Routes = \[{ path: '', redirectTo: 'data', pathMatch: 'full' },{ path: 'data', component: DataList },{ path: 'data/:id', component: DataDetails }\];

`Example of URL: localhost:3000/data/5`

## Passing Query Parameters

<a \[routerLink\]="\['data'\]" \[queryParams\]="{ page: 99 }">Go to Page 99</a>

Alternatively, we can navigate programmatically using the `Router` service:

goToPage(pageNum) {this.router.navigate(\['/data'\], { queryParams: { page: pageNum } });}
