In this article, I cover Angular interview questions. Because Angular is a framework, it has a lot of concepts and architectural patterns to learn about. As an Angular front lead, I grouped out these questions for you based on my experience.

You’ll notice that I grouped questions by general knowledge about Angular. Followed by technical questions. You’ll need, though, to be prepared for some coding too. So practice!

Ready, let’s go!

# General knowledge about Angular

## What is Angular?

**Answer:** Angular is an open-source, front-end web development framework based on TypeScript developed and supported by Google.

## What is TypeScript?

**Answer:** Typescript is a language based on javascript. Angular is based on the TypeScript language and HTML. HTML is used for the template, and TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) is used for components.

## Why prioritize TypeScript over JavaScript in Angular?

**Answer:** The typescript is created to overcome the Javascript shortcomings like typecasting of variables, classes, decorators, variable scope, and many more features and functions.

TypeScript is really powerful. To discover some of its powers, here is what I recommend:

## Why were client-side frameworks like Angular introduced?

**Answer:** Before, web developers used to use plain Javascript combined with jQuery to develop dynamic websites. The problem with this approach is that as long as the app grows, its code will become more tedious and complex to maintain. Therefore, the need to create something to facilitate and helps maintain, at the same time, a dynamic website code.

## How does an Angular application work?

**Answer:** the entry point is the main.ts file that is configured in the `angular.json`. From then on, the AppModule is bootstrapped. The module will then render the AppComponent by using `index.html` file.

## Can you describe some of the advantages of using Angular?

**Answer:** Angular helps create fast, dynamic, and scalable web applications with ease, using components and modules with a hierarchical dependency injection structure. It facilitates RESTful services and client-server communication with its core modules. Another advantage is that it provides the testing system (with Jasmine and Karma) and its environment already set.

To check how it is quick and easy to create an Angular app, I recommend checking this article that will take you through only 2 steps to create a whole Angular app from A to Z:

## 2 Steps to Create, Launch, Test & Discover Angular Application

### Quick and easy steps to discover Angular Application

famzil.medium.com



](https://famzil.medium.com/2-steps-to-create-launch-test-discover-angular-application-713387952e69?source=post_page-----78de06e5311f---------------------------------------)

## What are Angular major features?

-   Component-based architecture — applications are written as a set of independent components. Thus, the application will be built with a set of components (like puzzles)
-   Every puzzle can be created, tested, integrated using Angular CLI independently.
-   Great support for complex animations without writing much code by using Angular animation.
-   Thanks to the lazy loading feature, Angular supports automatic code-splitting. Hence only the code required to render a particular view is loaded.
-   Cross-platform application development. It can be used for all platforms, even for mobile apps.

## What Is the Single Page Application? How Is It Different From Traditional Web Technology?

**Answer:** Angular allows us to create a SPA. In a Single Page Application (SPA), only the home page (index.html) is maintained throughout even though the URL keeps changing. It is faster and easier to implement when compared with traditional web technology. In traditional technology, every time a user requests, the request is passed on to the server. This takes more time.

## What are directives in Angular? Describe the types of directives in Angular?

**Answer:** Directives are one of the core features of Angular. They allow an Angular developer to write new, application-specific HTML syntax. In fact, directives are functions executed by the Angular compiler when the same finds them in the DOM. Directives are of three types:

-   Attribute Directives
-   Component Directives
-   Structural Directives

## [What is a bootstrapping module?](https://github.com/sudheerj/angular-interview-questions#what-is-a-bootstrapping-module)

**Answer:** The root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called a bootstrapping module. Every Angular application has a bootstrapping module. It is also called the AppModule. The bootstrapping module is mentioned in the AppModule class.

## What is the difference between an Annotation and a Decorator in Angular?

Annotations in angular are “only” metadata set of the class using the reflect Metadata library. They are used to create an “annotation” array. On the other hand, decorators are the design patterns used for separating decoration or modification of a class without actually altering the source code.

## What are templates in Angular?

Templates are the HTML code rendered in the index.html file’s body. The HTML code is a combination of data coming from the controller or the component and the model to provide a dynamic view to the user finally.

Note that the difference between the traditional HTML code and the one used in an Angular app is that we can use some special elements and features (such as `*ngIf`, `ng-template`, `*ngFor`…) that are Angular specific and can’t be used in a regular HTML file outside an Angular app.

## Explain data binding in Angular? In Angular, what is string interpolation? What is interpolation?

In Angular, data binding is one of the most powerful and important features that allow you to define the communication between the component and DOM(Document Object Model).

This simplifies the communication between the template (HTML) and the controller (component’s class).

In Angular, there are four forms of data-binding:

1.  String Interpolation with: {{ variable }}

<li>Name: {{ user.name }}</li>  
<li>Address: {{ user.address }}</li>

1.  Property Binding with \[property\]=”value”

<input type="email" \[value\]="user.email">

1.  Event Binding with (click)=”functionName($event)”

<button (click)="logout()"></button>

1.  Two-Way Data Binding with \[(ngModel)\]=”variablename”

<input type="email" \[(ngModel)\]="user.email">

Note that the `[()]` is called the banana box. (you may get the same question by using this well-known keyword ;))

## Explain Components, Modules, and Services in Angular?

**Components:** Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app, which formed a tree of Angular components. These components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template, and only one component can be instantiated per element in a template.

**Modules:** Modules are logical boundaries in your application, and the application is divided into separate modules to separate your application's functionalities.

**Services:** A service is used when a common functionality needs to be provided to various modules. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for your application and better modularity by allowing you to extract common functionality out of components.

## What types of compilations are there in Angular?

**Answer:** Two types of compilations — AOT (Ahead-of-Time) and JIT (Just-in-Time).

With JIT, the compilation happens during run-time in the browser. It is the default way used by Angular. The commands used for JIT compilation are –

`ng build ng serve`

In the AOT compilation, the compiler compiles the code during the build itself. The CLI command for AOT compilation is -

`ng build --aot ng server –aot`

AOT is more suitable for the production environment, whereas JIT is much suited for local development.

## What are lifecycle hooks in Angular? Explain a few lifecycle hooks.

**Answer:** Angular components enter its lifecycle from the time it is created to the time it is destroyed. Angular hooks provide ways to tap into these phases and trigger changes at specific phases in a lifecycle.

**ngOnChanges( ):** This method is called whenever one or more input properties of the component changes. The hook receives a SimpleChanges object containing the previous and current values of the property.

**ngOnInit( ):** This hook gets called once, after the ngOnChanges hook.

It initializes the component and sets the input properties of the component.

**ngDoCheck( ):** It gets called after ngOnChanges and ngOnInit and is used to detect and act on changes that cannot be detected by Angular.

We can implement our change detection algorithm in this hook.

**ngAfterContentInit( ):** It gets called after the first ngDoCheck hook. This hook responds after the content gets projected inside the component.

**ngAfterContentChecked( ):** It gets called after ngAfterContentInit and every subsequent ngDoCheck. It responds after the projected content is checked.

**ngAfterViewInit( )**: It responds after a component’s view, or a child component’s view is initialized.

**ngAfterViewChecked( ):** It gets called after ngAfterViewInit, and it responds after the component’s view, or the child component’s view is checked.

**ngOnDestroy( ):** It gets called just before Angular destroys the component. This hook can be used to clean up the code and detach event handlers.

## What are pipes?

**Answer:** Pipe (|) is used to transform input data into the desired format. For example,

`<p>Price is {{ price | currency }}</p>`

With params:

<p>Price is {{ price | currency : “USD$” : 0.00 }}</p>

## What is Angular Router? What Is a Wildcard Route?

**Answer:** Angular Router is a mechanism in which navigation happens from one view to the next as users perform application tasks. It borrows the concepts or model of the browser’s application navigation.

Wildcard route has a path that consists of two asterisks (\*\*) that can match any URL. It is helpful when a URL doesn’t match any of the predefined routes. Instead of throwing errors, we can use a wildcard route and defining a component for the same.

## Is the Routing Module Mandatory for an Application?

**Answer:** No, the routing module can be totally skipped if there are simple configurations.

## Explain the difference between template drivenForms and reactive forms in Angular.

**Template Driven Forms:** These are model-driven forms where you write the logic, validations, controls, etc., in the template part of the code using directives. They are suitable for simple scenarios and uses two-way binding with \[(ngModel)\] syntax.

**Reactive Form:** is a model-driven approach for creating forms in a reactive style(form inputs changes over time). These are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values.

Again if you need a mental picture to help you have a clear idea about the difference between the two forms’ types:

## What is Angular CLI? How Do You Use It?

Angular CLI(Command Line Interface) is a command-line interface to scaffold and build angular apps. You need to install using the npm command below:

npm install @angular/cli@latest

Below I listed a few commands, which are so useful when creating angular projects

Creating a New Project:

`ng new`

Generating Components, Directives & Services:

`ng generate/g`

The different types of commands would be:

-   ng generate class my-new-class: add a class to your application
-   ng generate component my-new-component: add a component to your application
-   ng generate directive my-new-directive: add a directive to your application
-   ng generate enum my-new-enum: add an enum to your application
-   ng generate module my-new-module: add a module to your application
-   ng generate pipe my-new-pipe: add a pipe to your application
-   ng generate service my-new-service: add a service to your application

Running the Project: ng serve

## What’s the latest version of Angular? What Are the New Features in It?

At the time I’m writing this article, Angular has reached its 11th version. This question is usually asked for someone who has some experience in Angular or is an Angular expert to show that you are keeping up with news and technologies.

To learn more about new features, here is an article the sums up the most important features that come out with the latest version in Angular:

# Angular Technical questions

## What is AOT compilation?

-   **AOT(Ahead-of-Time) compilation:** The application compiles during the build time.

## What are the **Advantages of AOT compilation?**

-   **Fast Rendering:** The browser loads the executable code and renders it immediately as the application is compiled before running inside the browser.
-   **Fewer Ajax Requests:** The compiler sends the external HTML and CSS files along with the application, eliminating AJAX requests for those source files.
-   **Minimizing Errors:** Easy to detect and handle errors during the building phase.
-   **Better Security:** Before an application runs inside the browser, the AOT compiler adds HTML and templates into the JS files, so there are no extra HTML files to be read, thus providing better security for the application.

## Why do we need a compilation process?

The browser can only read and interpret 3 things: CSS, HTML, and Javascript. That’s why it’s important to generate the js and HTML files that can be interpreted by the browser.

## What Does the Representation \[()\] Mean?

**Answer:** This is a representation for ngModel used for two-way data binding. It is written as \[(ngModel)\] = “propertyvalue”.

It’s also called bananabox = two way data-binding.

## What Do You Know About the NPM Package?

**Answer:** The components, framework, and CLI used by Angular applications are packaged as npm packages. Npm packages can be downloaded using the npm CLI client. To be able to use npm, you need to install NodeJs.

For more details, I recommend this article since it also talks about Y_arn,_ which is even better than NPM:

## How Are Animations Done in Angular?

**Answer:** To use the animation module, it has to be enabled. For this, the BrowserAnimationModule has to be imported.

import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'; // After this, import the required animation functions into the // component files. Example:   
import { state, animate, transition, // ... } from '@angular/animations';

Next, add the animation metadata property within the @Component() decorator in the component file.

@Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: 'app.component.html', animations: \[ // animation triggers go here \] })

## What Is Package.json? What’s the difference between package.json vs. package-lock.json?

**Answer:** With `package.json` file, it becomes easy to manage the project dependencies. We can mention details like the version, language, etc.… in `package.json`. For example, if bootstrap is used in our project, we can mention the ng-bootstrap package and its version in `package.json`.

If you are not familiar with `package.json` I really recommend this article that will help you build a mental picture of what is `package.json` file in dept and what’s the difference between `package-lock.json` and some tips based on my experience.

## What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

TypeScript classes have a default method called a constructor, which is normally used for construction purposes. It has the same purpose as a standard class in Java, such as building an object and initializing it. The constructor is also used to inject the dependencies we need in the component.

On the other hand, the ngOnInit method is specific to Angular, especially used to define Angular bindings. The constructor is always called before ngOninit.

. In order to use ngOnInit, you need to implement the OnInit interface as below:

<iframe src="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/media/ab3ee33af0f05c2b9ae6258913d429be" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="344" width="680" title="AppComponent" class="eo n hk dz bg" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## What is zone in Angular?

A Zone is an execution context that persists across async tasks. Angular relies on zone.js to run Angular’s change detection processes when native JavaScript operations raise events.

## What is the purpose of the async pipe?

**Answer:** Async pipe subscribes to a promise or an observable and returns the latest value. If a new value is emitted, the pipe marks the component that needs to be checked for any changes.

`<code>observable|async</code>`

## Explain How You Can Chain Pipes?

**Answer:** We can add any number of filters using pipes -

`<p>Average is {{ average | uppercase | number}}</p>`

## Is It Possible to Create a Custom Pipe? If yes, How?

**Answer:** Yes, we can create custom pipes.

-   First, we need to import the @Pipe decorator from the core Angular library.
-   Pipe is a class that is decorated with the above metadata (@Pipe({name: ‘myCustomPipe’}))
-   The next step is to define the transformation. For this, the pipe class should implement the method transform() of the PipeTransform class.
-   Specify the pipe name in the template to call it.

`<p>Size: {{number | myCustomPipe: 'Error'}}</p>`

## How would you create a service within Angular?

Example of service:

<iframe src="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/media/88c37d7502417d10e17d984d952bfc84" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="366" width="680" title="Service example" class="eo n hk dz bg" scrolling="no"></iframe>

As we saw before, a service can be generated with the CLI commands.

If you have created the service manually, you’ll need to provide the service in the Module that will use it and inject it in the constructor of the component that will use it.

## What is HttpClient and its benefits?

Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over HTTP protocol using either XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API. Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as HttpClient, based on top of the XMLHttpRequest interface. This client can be imported from the`@angular/common/http` package.

import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below,

1.  Contains testability features
2.  Provides typed request and response objects
3.  Intercept request and response
4.  Supports Observalbe APIs
5.  Supports streamlined error handling

## What is **Dependency Injection (DI)**

Dependency injection (DI) is an important application design pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them themselves.

Angular comes with its own dependency injection framework for resolving dependencies. This is an important core concept of Angular. I recommend reading the article below to have a clear idea about dependency injection.

## What is codelyzer?

Codelyzer provides a set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects. To analyze an Angular application, you only need to run the following commands:

ng new codelyzer  
ng lint

## What are UI libraries you have used with Angular?

Tell only the UI libraries that you used:

Example:

-   Bootstrap
-   PrimeNG
-   Materials …etc

## Angular Language Service

The Angular Language Service is a way to get completions, errors, hints, and navigation inside your Angular templates, whether they are external in an HTML file or embedded in annotations/decorators in a string. It has the ability to autodetect that you are opening an Angular file, reads your `tsconfig.json` file finds all the templates you have in your application and then provides all the language services.

If you haven’t yet used Angular CLI, I recommend you to discover it. It one of the must-know things. Here is a quick article to have a mental picture of Angular CLI:

## What’s RxJs?

RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using Observables. Many APIs such as HttpClient produce and consume RxJS Observables and also uses operators for processing observables.

The RxJS library also provides below utility functions for creating and working with observables.

1.  Converting existing code for async operations into observables
2.  Iterating through the values in a stream
3.  Mapping values to different types
4.  Filtering streams
5.  Composing multiple streams

## What do you use for Unit testing in an Angular app?

-   Jasmine (for writing tests)
-   Karma or/ Jest (for running tests)

If you already use them, otherwise, don’t mention them as you can get a question about what’s the difference between Karma and Jest, for example, Or what do you prefer using Karama or Jest.

If you want me to cover the difference between Karam and Jest and which one is better, let me know in the comments section.

## What do you use for E2E testing in an Angular app?

So far, I personally used Cypress. But, if you haven’t E2E testing in Angular. No, worries. Be honest. For curious souls:

](/e2e-testing-with-cypress-angular-219eaa3926c?source=post_page-----78de06e5311f---------------------------------------)

## What’s the difference between stub and Mock?

**Stubs** provide canned answers to calls made during the test. _They_ are a very simplified object or data structure designed specifically for the test scenario. These can be constructed at the beginning of the test or per test.

**Mocks** are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. Mock objects are class instances that mimic an existing class to provide the same method interface and return specific values when a method call occurs.

## What’s an Observable?

An Observable is a unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language, so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS. The observables are created using a new keyword.

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';  
  
const observable = new Observable(observer => {  
  setTimeout(() => {  
    observer.next('Hello from a Observable!');  
  }, 2000);  
});

## What’s the difference between observables and promises

**Promise:**

-   Execute immediately on creation
-   Provide only once
-   Push errors to the child promises
-   Uses only .then() clause

**Observable:**

-   Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription so that they can be run whenever you need the result
-   Provide multiple values over time
-   Subscribe method is used for error handling, which makes centralized and predictable error handling
-   Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications

## What is metadata? How Is Metadata Represented in Angular?

**Answer:** Metadata is used to decorate a class so that it can configure the expected behavior of the class. The metadata is represented by decorators.

Metadata is represented using decorators like class decorators, property decorators, method decorators.

Examples of decorators in Angular

-   Class decorators: @Component and @NgModule
-   Property decorators: @Input and @Output
-   Method decorators: @HostListener
-   Parameter decorators: @Inject, Optional

## What Are Class Decorators in Angular?

**Answer:** The class decorator contains the metadata of the suitable class type. It appears just before the class definition and declares the class to be of a certain type. Some class decorators are:

-   @Component
-   @NgModule
-   @Pipe
-   @Directive
-   @Injectable.

# Finally …

Keep in mind that the keyword in an interview is your attitude. Be smiling, comfortable, and dare to say I don’t know, what is it, no one knows everything. A software engineer or a developer is someone that keeps learning and strive for knowledge. We all are learners. No one is born with previous knowledge.

Please let me a clap or feedback if this was helpful for more articles. If you want me to cover a specific concept in Angular in a future article, let me know. I’ll write it with love. ❤
