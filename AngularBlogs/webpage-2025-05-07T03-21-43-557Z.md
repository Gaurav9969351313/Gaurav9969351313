During my Angular developer interview, I was asked a seemingly simple question: **"What's the difference between ngIf and ngSwitch?" As an experienced Angular developer, I thought I knew the answer and was confident in my abilities.** **But unfortunately, I stumbled on this question and failed to answer it correctly.** **Let's take a closer look at the question and the answers.**

**Question**: What is ngIf in Angular?

**Answer**: ngIf is a built-in directive in Angular that is used to conditionally display an element on the DOM based on a Boolean expression.

**Question**: What is ngSwitch in Angular?

**Answer**: ngSwitch is another built-in directive in Angular that is used to conditionally render elements on the DOM based on a given expression.

**Question**: What's the difference between ngIf and ngSwitch?

**Answer**: The main difference between ngIf and ngSwitch is that ngIf only checks for a single condition and displays an element if it's true, while ngSwitch allows you to specify multiple conditions and renders elements based on the first match.

For example, consider the following code:

<div \[ngIf\]="isLoggedIn"\>  
  Welcome, {{ username }}!  
</div\>

This code will only display the welcome message if the isLoggedIn variable is true.

Now, let's look at the ngSwitch example:

<div \[ngSwitch\]="role"\>  
  <p \*ngSwitchCase\="'admin'"\>Welcome, Admin!</p\>  
  <p \*ngSwitchCase\="'moderator'"\>Welcome, Moderator!</p\>  
  <p \*ngSwitchDefault\>Welcome, User!</p\>  
</div\>

In this example, we're using ngSwitch to render different messages based on the value of the role variable. If the role is 'admin', it will display the message "Welcome, Admin!" and so on.

# 1\. What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

One of the common questions which pop up in the interviewer’s mind is what is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit? We mostly go with the answer that we write the dependencies in the constructors while we write logics in the ngOninit.

Sometimes, the interviewer will check what else we know about it? Why can’t we put the services or logics in constructors?

The simple answer is that sometimes, we need to wait until all dependencies get loaded; or for parent/child components, we might need to wait until the component is loaded. That’s why it’s preferable to write the logic in ngOnInit.

Let’s check other differences.

# 2\. What is the difference between components and directives?

This one is extremely common too. The easy answer is directives do not have their shadow DOM while components have their HTML. Components used to break our application based on features, while directives only help to change the behavior of certain elements.

Let’s check out some other differences.

# 3\. What is the difference between ElementRef, TemplateRef, and viewContainerRef?

This question comes for more advanced Angular interviews where the interviewer wants to check how you are manipulating views or do you have experience in creating dynamic views in your Angular application.

Let’s check out the difference between ElementRef, TemplateRef, and viewContainterRef with examples.

# 4\. What is the difference between ng-content,ng-template, and ng-container?

Doesn’t it look the same? Yes, when I was learning Angular all 3 keywords were the same for me but actually, all carry their own purposes.

Let’s check out the difference between ng-content,ng-template, and ng-container with examples.

# 5\. What is the difference between view-child and content-child?

We do deal with a lot of parent-child or sub-components. As Angular does support creating dynamic component on the fly or access the relative components based on their relation interviewer expect that we know the difference between view-child and content-child.

Let’s check the difference between view-child and content-child with the examples.

# 6\. What is the difference between component view, host view, and embedded view?

This is an advanced Angular interview question that can be asked to know how the different views work in Angular.

Let’s check the difference between component view, host-view, and embedded views with the examples.

# 7\. What is the difference between debounce time and throttle time?

When we deal with the reactive forms and want the user to type and check on service based on the inputs this two-term is very handy.
