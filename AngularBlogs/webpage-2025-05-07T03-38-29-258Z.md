# Introduction

Signals are a powerful feature in Angular that improve state management, reactivity, and change detection. In this tutorial, we walk through the process of building a simple Angular application using signals, `computed`, `linked signals`, and the experimental `RX Resource`. The example application dynamically displays Star Wars vehicle data and calculates totals based on user input.

# Understanding Signals in Angular

# What are Signals?

Signals are a new state management tool in Angular that provide a reactive way to manage and respond to state changes. Unlike traditional approaches like observables, signals are simpler, easier to reason about, and reduce change detection overhead.

# Key Signal Features Used:

1.  **Signal:** A reactive value that triggers updates when it changes.
2.  **Computed Signal:** A signal whose value is derived from other signals and recalculated automatically when dependencies change.
3.  **Linked Signal:** A signal that resets its value based on changes in a source signal.

# Building the Application

# Step 1: Setting Up the Angular Project

To begin, create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI

ng new signals\-in\-action \--standalone

Next, add `HTTPClientModule` for API requests and a service to handle data fetching.

# Step 2: Creating the Service with Signals

The `VehicleService` retrieves Star Wars vehicle data from the public SWAPI (Star Wars API). Signals are used to manage the app‚Äôs reactive state.

## Define the Service:

-   Inject the HTTP client to make API requests.
-   Use signals to manage key application state.

export class VehicleService {  
  vehicles = signal<Vehicle\[\]>(\[\]); // Holds fetched vehicle data  
  selectedVehicle = signal<Vehicle | undefined\>(undefined);  
  quantity = signal<number\>(1);  
  
totalCost = computed(() =>   
    (this.selectedVehicle()?.cost\_in\_credits || 0) \* this.quantity()  
  );  
  color = computed(() =>  
    this.totalCost() > 50000 ? 'green' : 'blue'  
  );  
}

# Explanation:

-   `signal<Vehicle[]>`: Holds the list of vehicles fetched from the API.
-   `selectedVehicle`: Tracks the user‚Äôs selected vehicle.
-   `computed`: Calculates the total cost based on selected vehicle and quantity.
-   Conditional styling (green/blue) is derived using `computed`.

# Step 3: Adding a Component with Signals

Create a `VehicleSelection` component:

ng generate component vehicle-selection --inline\-template --skip-tests

Inject the `VehicleService` into the component to access the signals. Bind the signals to the template using Angular‚Äôs reactive features.

## Template:

<div\>  
  <label\>Select Vehicle:</label\>  
  <select \[ngModel\]="vehicleService.selectedVehicle()"   
          (ngModelChange)="vehicleService.selectedVehicle.set($event)"\>  
    <option \*ngFor\="let v of vehicleService.vehicles()" \[value\]="v"\>  
      {{ v.name }}  
    </option\>  
  </select\>  
  
<label\>Quantity:</label\>  
  <input type\="number" \[ngModel\]="vehicleService.quantity()"   
         (ngModelChange)="vehicleService.quantity.set($event)" />  
  <div\>  
    <p\>Price: {{ vehicleService.selectedVehicle()?.cost\_in\_credits }}</p\>  
    <p \[style.color\]="vehicleService.color()"\>Total: {{ vehicleService.totalCost() }}</p\>  
  </div\>  
</div\>

# Key Features in the Template:

1.  **Two-Way Binding:** Signals are bound to user inputs (`select` and `input`) for reactivity.
2.  **Computed Signals:** Automatically calculate and update total cost and text color.

# Enhancing State Management with RX Resource

Angular 19 introduces `RX Resource`, which simplifies fetching data and converting it into reactive signals.

# Using RX Resource:

vehicleResource = rxResource(() =>   
  this.http.get<VehicleResponse>('https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/')  
    .pipe(map(response => response.results))  
);  
vehicles = computed(() => this.vehicleResource.value() || \[\]);

-   `RX Resource` fetches API data and converts it into a signal.
-   `computed` ensures the vehicle list is always reactive.

# Finalizing the Application

The completed app dynamically retrieves vehicle data, updates totals based on quantity, and conditionally changes styles when thresholds are met.

# Linked Signal for Resetting Quantity

To reset the quantity when a new vehicle is selected:

quantity = linkedSignal({  
  source: this.selectedVehicle,  
  compute: (selected) => (selected ? 1 : 0)  
});

This ensures the quantity resets to `1` when the user picks a new vehicle.

# Benefits of Using Signals

1.  **Improved Change Detection:** Signals provide precise updates, reducing unnecessary recalculations.
2.  **Declarative Code:** Code is easier to read and maintain with clear data flow.
3.  **Better Performance:** Signals simplify state management and reduce overhead.

# Conclusion

Using Angular‚Äôs signal features, we built a simple yet reactive application that dynamically manages state and calculates values. Signals, combined with computed and linked signals, provide a clean, efficient, and declarative way to handle reactivity.

By integrating RX Resource, we further enhanced the app‚Äôs state management for real-time data fetching. Signals are a game-changer for building scalable and maintainable Angular applications.
