Hey there, fellow coder! If you’re reading this, you’re probably gearing up for an SDE2 interview and want to crush it with Angular. First off, kudos for choosing to dive deep into one of the most robust front-end frameworks out there. I’ve been slinging code for over a decade, and Angular has been my trusty companion through countless dashboards, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise apps. In 2025, Angular remains a powerhouse thanks to its scalability, modern features like Signals, and a vibrant community.

This guide is your one-stop shop to master Angular for that SDE2 role. I’m sharing everything I’ve learned from real-world projects, late-night debugging sessions, and mentoring devs like you. We’ll cover _all_ the key Angular topics, with practical examples, 111 carefully curated interview questions, and pro tips to avoid the mistakes I made (trust me, there were plenty). Whether you’re building a fintech app or a healthcare portal, you’ll walk away ready to tackle any question an interviewer throws at you. Let’s dive in!

# Angular Architecture

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular’s architecture is the backbone of any app you build. It’s a component-based framework where everything — components, modules, services, directives, and pipes — works together like a well-oiled machine. Components handle the UI, modules organize your code, services manage logic, directives add behavior, and pipes transform data. For an SDE2 role, you need to know how these pieces fit together to create scalable apps.

## Real-Life Example

A few years back, I worked on a CRM tool for a mid-sized company. The app had a dashboard, customer profiles, and task management. We used Angular’s architecture to keep things modular:

-   **Components**: A DashboardComponent displayed stats, a ProfileComponent showed customer details, and a TaskListComponent handled tasks.
-   **Modules**: We created a DashboardModule to group related features, keeping the codebase clean.
-   **Services**: A CustomerService fetched data from the backend, shared across components.
-   **Directives**: A custom HighlightDirective added hover effects to task cards.
-   **Pipes**: A CurrencyPipe formatted prices dynamically.

Here’s a simplified version of the HighlightDirective:

import { Directive, ElementRef, HostListener } from '@angular/core';  
  
@Directive({  
  selector: '\[appHighlight\]'  
})  
export class HighlightDirective {  
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}  
  
  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {  
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = '#e0f7fa';  
  }  
  
  @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() {  
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = '';  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: The modular structure made it easy to add new features (like a reporting module) without breaking existing code. The app scaled to handle 10,000+ users smoothly.

**Common Pitfall**: Overloading components with business logic. I once stuffed API calls into a component, making it a nightmare to test. Always move logic to services for reusability and clarity.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What is the role of NgModule in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: NgModule organizes components, services, and other dependencies into cohesive blocks. It’s like a container for a feature set.
2.  **How do components communicate in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Use @Input, @Output, or services for data sharing. Explain parent-child vs. unrelated component communication.
3.  **What’s the difference between a structural and attribute directive?**  
    _Hint_: Structural directives (e.g., \*ngIf) modify DOM layout; attribute directives (e.g., ngClass) change appearance or behavior.
4.  **How would you lazy-load a component?**  
    _Hint_: Lazy loading is typically done at the module level, but discuss dynamic component loading with ComponentFactoryResolver for advanced cases.
5.  **Why use pipes instead of methods for data transformation?**  
    _Hint_: Pipes are memoized and optimized for change detection, improving performance over method calls.
6.  **Explain the lifecycle hooks of a component.**  
    _Hint_: Cover ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy, etc., with their use cases (e.g., ngOnInit for initialization).

## Pro Tip

Break your app into feature modules early on. It’s tempting to dump everything into AppModule, but trust me — future you will thank you when debugging a 50-component app.

# Dependency Injection

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Dependency Injection (DI) is Angular’s way of providing dependencies (like services) to components or other services without hardcoding them. It promotes loose coupling, making your code testable and maintainable. For SDE2 roles, understanding DI’s internals — like providers and injectors — is key.

## Real-Life Example

In a healthcare app, we needed to fetch patient data from multiple APIs. We created a PatientService to handle API calls:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';  
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';  
  
@Injectable({  
  providedIn: 'root'  
})  
export class PatientService {  
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}  
  
  getPatient(id: string) {  
    return this.http.get(\`/api/patients/${id}\`);  
  }  
}

In a PatientProfileComponent, we injected it:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';  
import { PatientService } from './patient.service';  
  
@Component({  
  selector: 'app-patient-profile',  
  template: \`<div>{{ patient | json }}</div>\`  
})  
export class PatientProfileComponent {  
  patient: any;  
  
  constructor(private patientService: PatientService) {  
    this.patientService.getPatient('123').subscribe(data => {  
      this.patient = data;  
    });  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: DI let us swap PatientService with a mock version for testing, saving us from hitting real APIs during development. When the API changed, we updated only the service, not every component.

**Common Pitfall**: Misusing providedIn: ‘root’. I once made every service root-provided, causing unnecessary instantiation. Use feature module providers for scoped services to save memory.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What is dependency injection in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: DI allows Angular to inject dependencies into components/services, managed by injectors.
2.  **What’s the difference between providing a service in ‘root’ vs. a module?**  
    _Hint_: Root creates a singleton; module scopes the service to that module’s injector.
3.  **How would you create a custom injector?**  
    _Hint_: Use Injector.create() for dynamic dependency resolution, rare but useful in advanced scenarios.
4.  **What happens if Angular can’t resolve a dependency?**  
    _Hint_: It throws a NullInjectorError. Discuss fallback tokens like Optional().
5.  **Explain hierarchical injectors.**  
    _Hint_: Angular creates an injector tree; child injectors inherit from parents unless overridden.

## Pro Tip

Always declare services as @Injectable(). I skipped this once, thinking it was optional, and Angular threw cryptic errors. Save yourself the headache.

# Routing and Navigation

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular’s router lets users navigate between views (components) without full page reloads. It supports lazy loading, guards, and resolvers, making it essential for building SPAs. SDE2 candidates need to master routing for complex apps.

## Real-Life Example

For an e-commerce platform, we set up routing for home, product, and checkout pages:

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';  
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';  
import { HomeComponent } from './home.component';  
import { ProductComponent } from './product.component';  
import { CheckoutComponent } from './checkout.component';  
  
const routes: Routes = \[  
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },  
  { path: 'product/:id', component: ProductComponent },  
  { path: 'checkout', component: CheckoutComponent, canActivate: \[AuthGuard\] }  
\];  
  
@NgModule({  
  imports: \[RouterModule.forRoot(routes)\],  
  exports: \[RouterModule\]  
})  
export class AppRoutingModule {}

We used a guard to protect the checkout page:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';  
import { CanActivate, Router } from '@angular/router';  
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';  
  
@Injectable({  
  providedIn: 'root'  
})  
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {  
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}  
  
  canActivate(): boolean {  
    if (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) {  
      return true;  
    }  
    this.router.navigate(\['/login'\]);  
    return false;  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: Users navigated seamlessly, and lazy loading the product module cut initial load time by 30%. The guard ensured only logged-in users accessed checkout.

**Common Pitfall**: Overcomplicating routes with nested paths. I once had a /products/category/subcategory/item mess — keep routes flat and use params for clarity.

## Interview Questions

1.  **How does Angular’s router work?**  
    _Hint_: It maps URLs to components using Routes configuration and updates the view via RouterOutlet.
2.  **What are route guards?**  
    _Hint_: Guards like CanActivate control navigation based on conditions (e.g., authentication).
3.  **Explain lazy loading in Angular.**  
    _Hint_: Load modules on demand using loadChildren to improve performance.
4.  **What’s a resolver, and when would you use it?**  
    _Hint_: Resolvers prefetch data before rendering a route, useful for data-heavy components.
5.  **How do you handle 404 routes?**  
    _Hint_: Use a wildcard path (path: ‘\*\*’) to catch unmatched routes.

## Pro Tip

Always test your guards and resolvers thoroughly. I once deployed a guard that redirected infinitely — yep, not my proudest moment.

# State Management

## What It Is and Why It Matters

State management handles data shared across components — like user sessions or app settings. Angular offers tools like NgRx for complex apps and Signals for lightweight reactivity. SDE2 roles often involve designing scalable state solutions.

## Real-Life Example

In a task management app, we used NgRx to manage tasks:

// task.actions.ts  
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';  
  
export const addTask = createAction('\[Task\] Add', props<{ task: string }>());  
export const removeTask = createAction('\[Task\] Remove', props<{ id: number }>());  
  
// task.reducer.ts  
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';  
import \* as TaskActions from './task.actions';  
  
export interface TaskState {  
  tasks: { id: number; name: string }\[\];  
}  
  
const initialState: TaskState = { tasks: \[\] };  
  
export const taskReducer = createReducer(  
  initialState,  
  on(TaskActions.addTask, (state, { task }) => ({  
    tasks: \[...state.tasks, { id: state.tasks.length + 1, name: task }\]  
  })),  
  on(TaskActions.removeTask, (state, { id }) => ({  
    tasks: state.tasks.filter(task => task.id !== id)  
  }))  
);

In a component:

@Component({  
  selector: 'app-task-list',  
  template: \`  
    <ul>  
      <li \*ngFor="let task of tasks$ | async"\>{{ task.name }}</li>  
    </ul>  
    <input #taskInput (keyup.enter)="addTask(taskInput.value)" />  
  \`  
})  
export class TaskListComponent {  
  tasks$ = this.store.select(state => state.tasks);  
  
  constructor(private store: Store<TaskState>) {}  
  
  addTask(name: string) {  
    this.store.dispatch(addTask({ task: name }));  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: NgRx centralized task state, making it easy to add features like undo/redo. Signals were later used for local component state, reducing boilerplate.

**Common Pitfall**: Overusing NgRx for simple state. I once built a whole store for a toggle — use Signals or services for lightweight cases.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What is NgRx, and when should you use it?**  
    _Hint_: NgRx implements Redux for predictable state management, ideal for complex apps.
2.  **How do Signals differ from NgRx?**  
    _Hint_: Signals are reactive primitives for local state, simpler than NgRx’s store.
3.  **What’s a selector in NgRx?**  
    _Hint_: Selectors extract specific state slices efficiently.
4.  **How would you debug state mismatches in NgRx?**  
    _Hint_: Use Redux DevTools and log actions to trace state changes.
5.  **When would you avoid state management libraries?**  
    _Hint_: For small apps, services or component state suffice.

## Pro Tip

Start with services for state. Only adopt NgRx when your app’s complexity justifies the overhead — trust me, it’s a beast to tame.

# Reactive Forms and Template-Driven Forms

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Forms are the heart of user interaction. Angular offers reactive forms (programmatic, scalable) and template-driven forms (simpler, directive-based). SDE2s need to know when to use each and how to handle validation.

## Real-Life Example

In a fintech app, we built a loan application form using reactive forms:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';  
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';  
  
@Component({  
  selector: 'app-loan-form',  
  template: \`  
    <form \[formGroup\]="loanForm" (ngSubmit)="submit()"\>  
      <input formControlName="amount" placeholder="Loan Amount" />  
      <div \*ngIf="loanForm.get('amount')?.invalid"\>Amount is required</div>  
      <button type="submit" \[disabled\]="loanForm.invalid"\>Apply</button>  
    </form>  
  \`  
})  
export class LoanFormComponent {  
  loanForm: FormGroup;  
  
  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {  
    this.loanForm = this.fb.group({  
      amount: \['', \[Validators.required, Validators.min(1000)\]\]  
    });  
  }  
  
  submit() {  
    console.log(this.loanForm.value);  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: Reactive forms made validation and dynamic fields (like co-applicant details) a breeze. We reused the form logic across multiple pages.

**Common Pitfall**: Mixing reactive and template-driven forms. I did this early on, and debugging became a mess — pick one and stick to it.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What’s the difference between reactive and template-driven forms?**  
    _Hint_: Reactive forms are code-driven and scalable; template-driven are template-based and simpler.
2.  **How do you add custom validators?**  
    _Hint_: Create a function returning a ValidatorFn for reactive forms.
3.  **What’s FormBuilder used for?**  
    _Hint_: Simplifies creating complex FormGroups and FormControls.
4.  **How do you handle form submission errors?**  
    _Hint_: Use form status and server-side error mapping.
5.  **When would you choose template-driven forms?**  
    _Hint_: For simple forms with minimal logic, like a login page.

## Pro Tip

Use reactive forms for anything complex. They’re verbose but worth it for maintainability — especially when your PM decides to add 10 new fields at the last minute.

# Observables and RxJS

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Observables (via RxJS) power asynchronous operations in Angular, like HTTP requests or event streams. Mastering operators like map, mergeMap, and debounceTime is crucial for SDE2 roles.

## Real-Life Example

In a search feature for a retail app, we used RxJS to debounce user input:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';  
import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';  
import { debounceTime, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';  
import { ProductService } from './product.service';  
  
@Component({  
  selector: 'app-search',  
  template: \`  
    <input \[formControl\]="searchControl" placeholder="Search products" />  
    <div \*ngFor="let product of products$ | async">{{ product.name }}</div>  
  \`  
})  
export class SearchComponent {  
  searchControl = new FormControl();  
  products$ = this.searchControl.valueChanges.pipe(  
    debounceTime(300),  
    switchMap(query => this.productService.search(query))  
  );  
  
  constructor(private productService: ProductService) {}  
}

**Outcome**: Debouncing cut API calls by 50%, improving performance and UX. switchMap ensured only the latest search query ran, avoiding race conditions.

**Common Pitfall**: Forgetting to unsubscribe. I once caused a memory leak by leaving subscriptions open — use async pipe or takeUntil to clean up.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What’s an Observable vs. a Promise?**  
    _Hint_: Observables handle multiple values over time; Promises resolve once.
2.  **What does switchMap do?**  
    _Hint_: Cancels prior requests and maps to a new Observable.
3.  **How do you handle errors in RxJS?**  
    _Hint_: Use catchError to gracefully handle failures.
4.  **What’s the purpose of debounceTime?**  
    _Hint_: Delays emissions to reduce frequent updates, ideal for search.
5.  **How do you combine multiple Observables?**  
    _Hint_: Use combineLatest, forkJoin, or merge based on needs.

## Pro Tip

Learn 5–10 RxJS operators cold (e.g., map, filter, switchMap). They cover 90% of use cases, and you’ll look like a wizard in interviews.

# Performance Optimization

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Performance is critical for user satisfaction. Angular offers tools like lazy loading, OnPush change detection, and trackBy to keep apps snappy. SDE2s must optimize large-scale apps effectively.

## Real-Life Example

In a dashboard app, a table rendering 1,000 rows was sluggish. We used OnPush and trackBy:

@Component({  
  selector: 'app-data-table',  
  template: \`  
    <table>  
      <tr \*ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackById">  
        <td>{{ item.name }}</td>  
      </tr>  
    </table>  
  \`,  
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush  
})  
export class DataTableComponent {  
  @Input() items: { id: number; name: string }\[\] = \[\];  
  
  trackById(index: number, item: { id: number }) {  
    return item.id;  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: OnPush reduced unnecessary checks, and trackBy minimized DOM updates, cutting render time from 2s to 200ms.

**Common Pitfall**: Overusing OnPush without understanding inputs. I once broke a component by forgetting to mark it for check — use ChangeDetectorRef wisely.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What is change detection in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: It syncs model and view; default checks all components.
2.  **How does OnPush improve performance?**  
    _Hint_: Only checks when inputs or events change.
3.  **What’s the purpose of trackBy in ngFor?**  
    _Hint_: Tracks items by unique IDs to avoid re-rendering.
4.  **How do you lazy-load modules?**  
    _Hint_: Use loadChildren in routes to defer module loading.
5.  **How would you optimize a slow component?**  
    _Hint_: Profile with DevTools, use OnPush, and memoize expensive computations.

## Pro Tip

Always profile before optimizing. I wasted hours tweaking a component that wasn’t the bottleneck — Chrome’s Performance tab is your friend.

# Angular CLI and Build Tools

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular CLI streamlines development with commands for generating code, building, and testing. SDE2s need to leverage it for productivity and optimized builds.

## Real-Life Example

For a startup’s MVP, we used Angular CLI to scaffold a blog app:

ng new blog\-app  
ng generate component post\-list  
ng generate service post  
ng build \--prod

We customized the build in angular.json to reduce bundle size:

"configurations": {  
  "production": {  
    "optimization": true,  
    "outputHashing": "all",  
    "sourceMap": false,  
    "extractCss": true,  
    "namedChunks": false,  
    "aot": true,  
    "vendorChunk": true,  
    "buildOptimizer": true  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: CLI cut setup time, and the optimized build shaved 40% off the bundle size, making the app load faster on mobile.

**Common Pitfall**: Ignoring build configs. I once deployed without AOT, bloating the bundle — always enable production optimizations.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What does ng generate do?**  
    _Hint_: Creates components, services, etc., with boilerplate code.
2.  **How do you optimize an Angular build?**  
    _Hint_: Use AOT, tree-shaking, and minification.
3.  **What’s the difference between ng serve and ng build?**  
    _Hint_: ng serve is for development; ng build creates deployable artifacts.
4.  **How do you add a custom webpack config to Angular CLI?**  
    _Hint_: Use @angular-builders/custom-webpack for advanced tweaks.
5.  **What’s AOT compilation?**  
    _Hint_: Compiles templates at build time for faster rendering.

## Pro Tip

Memorize ng g c/s/m shortcuts for components, services, and modules. It’s a small thing, but it saves time and impresses interviewers.

# Testing

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Testing ensures your app works as expected. Angular supports unit tests (Jasmine/Karma) and e2e tests (Cypress/Protractor). SDE2s must write robust tests for maintainable code.

## Real-Life Example

In a booking app, we tested a BookingService:

import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';  
import { HttpClientTestingModule, HttpTestingController } from '@angular/common/http/testing';  
import { BookingService } from './booking.service';  
  
describe('BookingService', () => {  
  let service: BookingService;  
  let httpMock: HttpTestingController;  
  
  beforeEach(() => {  
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({  
      imports: \[HttpClientTestingModule\],  
      providers: \[BookingService\]  
    });  
    service = TestBed.inject(BookingService);  
    httpMock = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);  
  });  
  
  it('should fetch bookings', () => {  
    const mockBookings = \[{ id: 1, date: '2025-04-10' }\];  
  
    service.getBookings().subscribe(bookings => {  
      expect(bookings).toEqual(mockBookings);  
    });  
  
    const req = httpMock.expectOne('/api/bookings');  
    req.flush(mockBookings);  
  });  
  
  afterEach(() => {  
    httpMock.verify();  
  });  
});

**Outcome**: Tests caught a bug where failed API calls weren’t handled, saving us from a production issue. Cypress e2e tests ensured the booking flow worked end-to-end.

**Common Pitfall**: Skimping on test coverage. I once ignored edge cases, and a null error slipped through — aim for 80%+ coverage.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What’s the difference between unit and e2e tests?**  
    _Hint_: Unit tests check components/services; e2e tests verify user flows.
2.  **How do you mock dependencies in Jasmine?**  
    _Hint_: Use TestBed and spies to mock services.
3.  **What’s HttpClientTestingModule used for?**  
    _Hint_: Mocks HTTP requests for testing services.
4.  **How do you test a component with async operations?**  
    _Hint_: Use fakeAsync or waitForAsync to handle promises/Observables.
5.  **Why use Cypress over Protractor?**  
    _Hint_: Cypress is faster and easier to debug, though Protractor’s Angular-specific.

## Pro Tip

Write tests as you code, not after. It feels tedious, but catching bugs early is worth it — especially when your PM asks for “one small change” before launch.

# Angular Universal and SSR

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular Universal enables server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and faster initial loads. SDE2s need to understand SSR’s benefits and challenges for public-facing apps.

## Real-Life Example

For a news portal, we implemented SSR to boost SEO:

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';  
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';  
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';  
import { ServerModule } from '@angular/platform-server';  
  
@NgModule({  
  declarations: \[AppComponent\],  
  imports: \[  
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'news-app' }),  
    ServerModule  
  \],  
  bootstrap: \[AppComponent\]  
})  
export class AppServerModule {}

We prerendered routes in angular.json:

"server": {  
  "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:server",  
  "options": {  
    "outputPath": "dist/server",  
    "main": "src/main.server.ts",  
    "tsConfig": "tsconfig.server.json"  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: Google indexed our articles faster, and first paint dropped from 3s to 1s, increasing user retention by 15%.

**Common Pitfall**: Ignoring browser-only APIs. I once used window in SSR code, crashing the server — use PLATFORM\_ID to check the environment.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What is Angular Universal?**  
    _Hint_: Enables SSR for Angular apps, improving SEO and load times.
2.  **How does SSR differ from client-side rendering?**  
    _Hint_: SSR renders HTML on the server; CSR renders in the browser.
3.  **What’s prerendering in Angular Universal?**  
    _Hint_: Generates static HTML at build time for specific routes.
4.  **How do you handle browser-only APIs in SSR?**  
    _Hint_: Use isPlatformBrowser() or TransferState to share data.
5.  **What are the downsides of SSR?**  
    _Hint_: Increases server load and complexity; not ideal for all apps.

## Pro Tip

Start with prerendering for static pages before diving into full SSR. It’s simpler and often enough for SEO gains.

# Angular Material and UI Integration

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular Material provides pre-built UI components (buttons, dialogs, etc.) following Material Design. SDE2s must integrate it efficiently for consistent, accessible UIs.

## Real-Life Example

In an HR portal, we used Angular Material for a user table:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';  
import { MatTableDataSource } from '@angular/material/table';  
  
@Component({  
  selector: 'app-user-table',  
  template: \`  
    <table mat-table \[dataSource\]="dataSource"\>  
      <ng-container matColumnDef="name"\>  
        <th mat-header-cell \*matHeaderCellDef>Name</th>  
        <td mat-cell \*matCellDef="let user"\>{{ user.name }}</td>  
      </ng-container>  
      <tr mat-header-row \*matHeaderRowDef="\['name'\]"\></tr>  
      <tr mat-row \*matRowDef="let row; columns: \['name'\]"\></tr>  
    </table>  
  \`  
})  
export class UserTableComponent {  
  dataSource = new MatTableDataSource(\[{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }\]);  
}

**Outcome**: Material’s table component gave us sorting and pagination out of the box, saving days of custom coding. The UI was accessible and responsive.

**Common Pitfall**: Overriding Material styles. I once hacked CSS to “fix” a button, breaking its responsiveness — use theme variables instead.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What is Angular Material?**  
    _Hint_: A UI component library implementing Material Design.
2.  **How do you customize Angular Material themes?**  
    _Hint_: Override SCSS variables or use custom themes in angular.json.
3.  **What’s MatTableDataSource used for?**  
    _Hint_: Manages data for Material tables, supporting filtering/sorting.
4.  **How do you ensure accessibility with Angular Material?**  
    _Hint_: Use built-in ARIA attributes and test with screen readers.
5.  **When would you avoid Angular Material?**  
    _Hint_: For custom designs not aligned with Material guidelines.

## Pro Tip

Use Material’s CDK (Component Dev Kit) for reusable behaviors like drag-drop, even if you don’t use the full component set.

# Interceptors and HTTP Client

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular’s HttpClient handles API calls, and interceptors modify requests/responses globally (e.g., adding headers). SDE2s must use them for clean, reusable networking code.

## Real-Life Example

In a SaaS app, we used an interceptor to add auth tokens:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';  
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler } from '@angular/common/http';  
  
@Injectable()  
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {  
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any\>, next: HttpHandler) {  
    const authToken = localStorage.getItem('token');  
    const authReq = req.clone({  
      setHeaders: { Authorization: \`Bearer ${authToken}\` }  
    });  
    return next.handle(authReq);  
  }  
}

Registered in AppModule:

providers: \[  
  { provide: HTTP\_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true }  
\]

**Outcome**: Every API call got the token automatically, reducing boilerplate and ensuring secure requests.

**Common Pitfall**: Mutating requests incorrectly. I once forgot to clone the request, breaking other interceptors — always use clone().

## Interview Questions

1.  **What’s an HTTP interceptor?**  
    _Hint_: Modifies HTTP requests/responses globally.
2.  **How do you handle API errors centrally?**  
    _Hint_: Use an interceptor with catchError to log or redirect.
3.  **What’s the benefit of HttpClient over fetch?**  
    _Hint_: HttpClient integrates with Angular’s DI and RxJS.
4.  **How do you add multiple interceptors?**  
    _Hint_: Angular chains them in the order provided.
5.  **How do you mock HTTP calls in tests?**  
    _Hint_: Use HttpClientTestingModule and HttpTestingController.

## Pro Tip

Chain interceptors thoughtfully. Logging, auth, and error handling should each have their own — keep them single-purpose for clarity.

# Security Best Practices

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Security protects users from threats like XSS or CSRF. Angular has built-in safeguards, but SDE2s must apply best practices to keep apps safe.

## Real-Life Example

In a social media app, we prevented XSS in user comments:

@Component({  
  selector: 'app-comment',  
  template: \`  
    <div \[innerHTML\]="comment | sanitize"></div>  
  \`  
})  
export class CommentComponent {  
  @Input() comment: string;  
}  
  
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';  
import { DomSanitizer, SafeHtml } from '@angular/platform-browser';  
  
@Pipe({ name: 'sanitize' })  
export class SanitizePipe implements PipeTransform {  
  constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}  
  
  transform(value: string): SafeHtml {  
    return this.sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, value);  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: Malicious scripts in comments were stripped, protecting users. We also used CSP headers to lock down external scripts.

**Common Pitfall**: Bypassing sanitization. I once used bypassSecurityTrustHtml for convenience and regretted it — always sanitize user input.

## Interview Questions

1.  **How does Angular prevent XSS?**  
    _Hint_: Escapes template bindings and sanitizes HTML.
2.  **What’s the DomSanitizer used for?**  
    _Hint_: Safely handles dynamic HTML, URLs, or styles.
3.  **How do you prevent CSRF in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Use HttpClient, which includes XSRF tokens by default.
4.  **What’s a Content Security Policy?**  
    _Hint_: Restricts resource loading to prevent malicious scripts.
5.  **How do you secure API keys in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Store them server-side, not in client code.

## Pro Tip

Audit your app with tools like OWASP ZAP. It’s eye-opening to see what you missed, and it’s better to catch it before a hacker does.

# Standalone Components and Modern Features

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Standalone components (introduced in Angular 14) eliminate the need for NgModules in many cases. Features like Signals and deferrable views (Angular 17+) simplify reactivity and performance. SDE2s must stay current with these trends.

## Real-Life Example

In a weather app, we used a standalone component with Signals:

import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';  
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';  
  
@Component({  
  selector: 'app-weather',  
  standalone: true,  
  template: \`  
    <input (input)="city.set($event.target.value)" />  
    <div>{{ weather() | json }}</div>  
    @defer (when city()) {  
      <app-forecast \[city\]="city()" />  
    }  
  \`  
})  
export class WeatherComponent {  
  city = signal('');  
  weather = signal<any>(null);  
  
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {  
    effect(() => {  
      this.http.get(\`/api/weather/${this.city()}\`).subscribe(data => {  
        this.weather.set(data);  
      });  
    });  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: No module boilerplate, and Signals made state updates reactive. @defer lazy-loaded the forecast, improving initial render.

**Common Pitfall**: Mixing standalone and module-based components. I tried this and got injector errors — migrate gradually.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What are standalone components?**  
    _Hint_: Components that don’t require NgModules, simplifying structure.
2.  **How do Signals work in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Reactive primitives for fine-grained state updates.
3.  **What’s the benefit of deferrable views?**  
    _Hint_: Lazy-loads template blocks for better performance.
4.  **How do you migrate to standalone components?**  
    _Hint_: Convert modules to standalone, updating imports and providers.
5.  **What’s the role of effect() in Signals?**  
    _Hint_: Runs side effects when Signals change.

## Pro Tip

Experiment with Signals in a side project. They’re a game-changer, but you’ll need practice to avoid overcomplicating simple state.

# Integration with APIs and Third-Party Libraries

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Angular apps often connect to APIs and libraries (e.g., charts, auth). SDE2s must integrate them seamlessly while keeping code clean.

## Real-Life Example

In a dashboard, we used Chart.js for analytics:

import { Component, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';  
import { Chart } from 'chart.js/auto';  
  
@Component({  
  selector: 'app-analytics',  
  template: \`<canvas #chart></canvas>\`  
})  
export class AnalyticsComponent implements AfterViewInit {  
  @ViewChild('chart') chartCanvas!: ElementRef;  
  
  ngAfterViewInit() {  
    new Chart(this.chartCanvas.nativeElement, {  
      type: 'bar',  
      data: {  
        labels: \['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar'\],  
        datasets: \[{ data: \[10, 20, 30\] }\]  
      }  
    });  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: Chart.js integrated smoothly, and wrapping it in a component kept the code reusable across dashboards.

**Common Pitfall**: Not typing third-party libraries. I skipped @types/chart.js once, and TypeScript errors haunted me — install types or declare modules.

## Interview Questions

1.  **How do you integrate a third-party library in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Install via npm, import, and wrap in components/services.
2.  **What’s the benefit of wrapping libraries in services?**  
    _Hint_: Encapsulates logic for testability and reuse.
3.  **How do you handle API rate limits?**  
    _Hint_: Use RxJS operators like debounceTime or queue requests.
4.  **What’s a typed API response?**  
    _Hint_: Use interfaces to define API response shapes.
5.  **How do you lazy-load a heavy library?**  
    _Hint_: Dynamically import it with import() in a service.

## Pro Tip

Create an ExternalLibsModule to import and provide third-party dependencies. It keeps your AppModule clean and makes upgrades easier.

# Deployment and CI/CD Pipelines

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Deploying Angular apps requires optimized builds and CI/CD pipelines for automation. SDE2s must ensure reliable, repeatable deployments.

## Real-Life Example

For a startup’s app, we set up a GitHub Actions pipeline:

name: Deploy Angular App  
on:  
  push:  
    branches: \[main\]  
jobs:  
  build:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      \- uses: actions/checkout@v3  
      \- uses: actions/setup-node@v3  
        with:  
          node-version: '18'  
      \- run: npm ci  
      \- run: npm run build \-- \--prod  
      \- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1  
        with:  
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID }}  
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY }}  
          aws-region: us-east-1  
      \- run: aws s3 sync dist/ s3://my-bucket

**Outcome**: Automated builds and deployments to S3 cut release time from hours to minutes. Rollbacks were painless with versioned buckets.

**Common Pitfall**: Hardcoding secrets. I exposed an API key in a pipeline once — use environment variables or secrets management.

## Interview Questions

1.  **How do you deploy an Angular app?**  
    _Hint_: Build with ng build — prod and host on S3, Firebase, or Netlify.
2.  **What’s the role of environment.ts?**  
    _Hint_: Configures environment-specific settings like API URLs.
3.  **How do you set up CI/CD for Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to build, test, and deploy.
4.  **What’s a multi-stage build?**  
    _Hint_: Separates build and runtime environments for smaller images.
5.  **How do you handle rollbacks in CI/CD?**  
    _Hint_: Use versioned deployments or blue-green strategies.

## Pro Tip

Test your pipeline locally with tools like act. It’s a lifesaver when your deploy fails at 2 a.m.

# Common Design Patterns

## What It Is and Why It Matters

Design patterns like singleton, facade, or container-presenter make Angular apps maintainable. SDE2s must apply them appropriately.

# Real-Life Example

In a logistics app, we used a facade pattern to simplify state access:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';  
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';  
import { selectShipment } from './shipment.selectors';  
  
@Injectable({  
  providedIn: 'root'  
})  
export class ShipmentFacade {  
  shipment$ = this.store.select(selectShipment);  
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {}  
  
  loadShipment(id: string) {  
    this.store.dispatch(loadShipment({ id }));  
  }  
}

**Outcome**: Components called facade.loadShipment() instead of dispatching actions, reducing complexity and improving testability.

**Common Pitfall**: Overengineering patterns. I once built a mediator for a simple app — use patterns only when they solve real problems.

## Interview Questions

1.  **What’s a singleton pattern in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Services providedIn: ‘root’ create a single instance.
2.  **How does the facade pattern help?**  
    _Hint_: Simplifies access to complex subsystems like NgRx.
3.  **What’s a container-presenter pattern?**  
    _Hint_: Containers handle logic; presenters display data.
4.  **When would you use a strategy pattern?**  
    _Hint_: For interchangeable algorithms, like sorting methods.
5.  **What’s the observer pattern in Angular?**  
    _Hint_: Implemented via EventEmitter and RxJS Observables.

## Pro Tip

Learn the facade pattern — it’s a lifesaver for hiding NgRx complexity from components. Your team will love you for it.
