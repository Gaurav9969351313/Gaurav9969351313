# Question 1: What is Module Federation and how can it be used with Angular?

**Answer:**

**Module Federation** (introduced with Webpack 5) allows multiple Angular applications to dynamically share and consume code (like components or modules) at runtime without recompiling.

Itâ€™s commonly used in **micro frontend architectures**.

**Basic Setup:**

-   Configure `webpack.config.js` with `ModuleFederationPlugin`
-   Expose modules in one app (host) and consume in another (remote)

> _âœ… Use_ `_@angular-architects/module-federation_` _to simplify integration._

# Question 2: How does Angular support Accessibility (a11y)?

**Answer:**

Angular promotes accessibility through:

-   Semantic HTML
-   Built-in directives like `aria-*`
-   `@angular/cdk/a11y` package
-   Keyboard interaction support

**Example (Focusable element with ARIA):**

<button aria-label\="Close modal" (click)="close()"\>X</button\>

> _âœ… Tools like_ **_axe-core_**_,_ **_NVDA_**_, and_ **_Chrome DevTools_** _help audit accessibility._

# Question 3: What is Angular Universal and why is it used?

**Answer:**

**Angular Universal** enables **server-side rendering (SSR)** of Angular applications.

**Benefits:**

-   Improved SEO (Google can crawl HTML content)
-   Faster initial load
-   Better performance on low-end devices

**Basic Workflow:**

-   Create a Universal app using `ng add @nguniversal/express-engine`
-   Server renders HTML and sends it to the browser

> _âœ… Ideal for public-facing apps with SEO needs (e.g., e-commerce, blogs)_

# Question 4: Explain Dependency Injection Hierarchy in Angular.

**Answer:**

Angular has a **hierarchical injector system**:

-   **Root injector:** Created at application start
-   **Module injector:** Specific to a lazy-loaded module
-   **Component injector:** Scoped to a component and its children

**Example:**

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) // Singleton  
export class ApiService {}

**Use** `**providers: []**` **in components** if you want scoped services.

> _âœ… Use caution: providing the same service in multiple injectors can create unexpected multiple instances._

# Question 5: What is `switchMap` in RxJS and how does it differ from `mergeMap`?

**Answer:**

-   `switchMap`: Cancels previous inner observable when a new value arrives.
-   `mergeMap`: Keeps all inner observables running simultaneously.

**Use Case for** `**switchMap**`**:** HTTP search autocomplete â€“ cancel previous request when user types again.

**Example:**

this.searchInput.valueChanges.pipe(  
  debounceTime(300),  
  switchMap(query => this.api.search(query))  
).subscribe(results => this.items = results);

> _âœ… Use_ `_switchMap_` _to avoid race conditions with HTTP requests._

ðŸŽ¯ Thatâ€™s it for **Day 9**! Youâ€™re mastering some of the most powerful features Angular has to offer. Stick around for Day 10 â€” weâ€™ll go even deeper!
