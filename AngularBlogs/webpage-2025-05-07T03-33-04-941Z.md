As you progress to higher levels of Angular development, it‚Äôs essential to understand more intricate concepts and features that go beyond the basics. In this blog, we explore **20 hard-level Angular interview questions** that delve into advanced topics such as **performance optimization**, **custom decorators**, **dynamic component loading**, and **web workers**. These questions are designed to challenge your expertise and deepen your understanding of Angular‚Äôs powerful tools and techniques. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for a senior role or just looking to elevate your skills, this guide will provide valuable insights into Angular‚Äôs advanced capabilities. Let‚Äôs dive in!

# 1\. What is the difference between `ngOnInit` and `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hooks?

**A:**

-   `ngOnInit`: Called once after the component‚Äôs data-bound properties are initialized.
-   `ngAfterViewInit`: Called after the component's view (and child views) are initialized.

**Example:**

ngOnInit() {  
  console.log('ngOnInit called');  
}  
ngAfterViewInit() {  
  console.log('ngAfterViewInit called');  
}

# 2\. What are `ngDoCheck` and `ngOnChanges`, and when should they be used?

**A:**

-   `ngDoCheck`: Called during every change detection run. Used for custom change detection logic.
-   `ngOnChanges`: Called when any input property changes.

**Example:**

ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {  
  console.log('Changes detected:', changes);  
}  
ngDoCheck() {  
  console.log('Custom change detection');  
}

# 3\. Explain the concept of `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.

**A:** The `OnPush` change detection strategy optimizes Angular performance by checking for changes only when an input property or event occurs, rather than on every change detection cycle.

**Example:**

@Component({  
  selector: 'app-example',  
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,  
  template: \`<div>{{ data }}</div>\`  
})  
export class ExampleComponent {  
  @Input() data: string;  
}

# 4\. What are the key differences between Angular‚Äôs `Injector` and `ReflectiveInjector`?

**A:**

-   `Injector`: The base class for DI in Angular, used to inject services.
-   `ReflectiveInjector`: An older injector class, now deprecated, providing more flexible DI capabilities for reflection-based injections.

# 5\. How would you implement a custom `asyncValidator` in Angular?

**A:** An `asyncValidator` is used for asynchronous form validation, often for server-side checks.

**Example:**

export function asyncEmailValidator(http: HttpClient) {  
  return (control: AbstractControl) => {  
    return http.get(\`api/check-email/${control.value}\`).pipe(  
      map(response => (response ? null : { emailTaken: true }))  
    );  
  };  
}  
this.form = this.fb.group({  
  email: \['', \[Validators.required\], \[asyncEmailValidator(this.http)\]\]  
});

# 6\. How do you prevent memory leaks in Angular components?

**A:** Memory leaks occur when subscriptions, event listeners, or DOM references are not properly disposed of. Use `ngOnDestroy` to unsubscribe from observables and remove event listeners.

**Example:**

ngOnDestroy() {  
  this.subscription.unsubscribe();  // Unsubscribing from an observable  
}

# 7\. What is the difference between `ngModel` and Reactive Forms in Angular?

**A:**

-   `ngModel`: Template-driven forms, automatically handles form control updates.
-   Reactive Forms: Programmatically defined forms that offer more control and better validation support.

# 8\. How does Angular handle dynamic component loading?

**A:** Use `ComponentFactoryResolver` to load components dynamically at runtime.

**Example:**

import { ComponentFactoryResolver, ViewContainerRef, Component } from '@angular/core';  
@Component({ selector: 'app-dynamic', template: '' })  
export class DynamicComponent {  
  constructor(private resolver: ComponentFactoryResolver, private viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) {}  
   loadComponent(component: Type<any\>) {  
    const factory = this.resolver.resolveComponentFactory(component);  
    this.viewContainerRef.clear();  
    this.viewContainerRef.createComponent(factory);  
  }  
}

# 9\. What is the `ng-template` directive, and how is it used?

**A:** `ng-template` is used to define a template that can be rendered conditionally, often with structural directives like `*ngIf`or `*ngFor`.

**Example:**

<ng-template \[ngIf\]="isVisible"\>  
  <p\>This will be displayed if isVisible is true.</p\>  
</ng-template\>

# 10\. Explain the concept of Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.

**A:** AOT compiles Angular templates and components into efficient JavaScript code during the build process, improving performance and reducing the size of the application.

# 11\. How would you optimize Angular applications for performance?

**A:** Some techniques include:

-   Lazy loading modules.
-   Using the `OnPush` change detection strategy.
-   Avoiding unnecessary bindings.
-   Using trackBy with `*ngFor`.

# 12\. What are Web Workers in Angular, and how are they used?

**A:** Web Workers run JavaScript in the background on a separate thread to improve app performance.

**Example:**

if (typeof Worker !== 'undefined') {  
  const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker', import.meta.url));  
  worker.postMessage('Hello Worker');  
  worker.onmessage = ({ data }) => console.log(data);  
}

# 13\. What are Angular‚Äôs `trackBy` and why is it important?

**A:** `trackBy` is used in `*ngFor` to track changes in a list more efficiently, reducing the number of DOM manipulations.

**Example:**

<div \*ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackByFn"\>  
  {{ item.name }}  
</div>  
trackByFn(index, item) {  
  return item.id; // Track by item id  
}

# 14\. Explain Angular‚Äôs custom decorators and how they are created.

**A:** Custom decorators are used to add metadata to classes, properties, methods, or parameters. Angular provides decorators like `@Input`, `@Output`, and `@Component`.

**Example (Custom Decorator):**

function Log(target: any, key: string) {  
  let value = target\[key\];  
  const getter = () => value;  
  const setter = (newVal) => {  
    console.log(\`Setting ${key} to ${newVal}\`);  
    value = newVal;  
  };  
  Object.defineProperty(target, key, { get: getter, set: setter });  
}

# 15\. How do you handle Internationalization (i18n) in Angular?

**A:** Angular provides the `@angular/localize` package for i18n support. It allows you to translate strings in templates and create different language versions of your application.

# 16\. How do you secure Angular applications against XSS and CSRF?

**A:**

-   Use Angular‚Äôs built-in sanitization for data binding to prevent XSS attacks.
-   Use `HttpClient` with a CSRF token for CSRF protection.

# 17\. What are `ng-content` and its use in Angular?

**A:** `ng-content` allows you to project content into a component, enabling content distribution in a reusable component.

**Example:**

<app-card\>  
  <ng-content\></ng-content\>  
</app-card\>

# 18\. Explain how Angular handles Dependency Injection in more complex scenarios.

**A:** Angular provides a hierarchical injector system, where services can be injected at different levels (root, module, component).

# 19\. What is the role of Service Workers in Angular PWA (Progressive Web App)?

**A:** Service Workers enable caching, background sync, and offline capabilities for Angular apps, improving performance and user experience in a PWA.

# 20\. How does Angular handle module bundling and tree shaking?

**A:** Angular uses Webpack for bundling and tree shaking to remove unused code during the build process, reducing the application‚Äôs final bundle size.
