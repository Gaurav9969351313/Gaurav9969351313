Recently, I was trying to prepare myself for upcoming interviews and it was a bit difficult to search in Google and open the links only to see the same questions each and every time. So, I thought of sharing what I have found and what are the most common questions someone should know if they are preparing for an interview.

Below are the most common interview questions asked in the latest Angular interviews. These Angular interview questions and answers help to prepare Angular developers for interviews ranging from junior to senior levels. Moreover, this article covers the basics to advance Angular interview questions which you must prepare in 2021.

# 31\. Explain different guards supported in Angular.

This is one of the most common questions asked in the Angular application.

There are five main guards in angular. which guards the access of routes.

-   `CanActivate` : will be called before going to the route: _can be used to prevent routing to a specific path_
-   `CanActivateChild` : will be called before going to the child component: _can be used to prevent the loading of child path_
-   `CanDeactivate` : will be called before destroying the component: _can be used to handle the browser events_
-   `CanLoad` : will be called before loading the module: _can be used to prevent the loading of the module_
-   `Resolve` : will be called before loading component: _can be used to prefetch data before loading component_

# 32\. What is the best way too lazy load the component?

Lazy loading the modules is one of the best practices when we want to reduce the bundle sizes and avoid loading all modules together.

But What about the lazy loading component? It means we load modules but don’t load components until we need them. It basically creates dynamic components as required and destroying right after use.

**_Let’s checkout practical code to understand this concept better._**

The below article explains how we can lazy load components in angular.

# 33\. What is the way we can display the app version in Angular?

When we deal with a lot of deployment it is best to display the app version which helps to communicate among the team with the changes.

It can be achieved by following these steps.

1.  open `/tsconfig.json` make resolveJsonModule as true.

"compilerOptions": {  
      ...  
      "resolveJsonModule": true  
      ...

Then in the component we can use version.

import { version } from '../../package.json';  
    ...  
    export class AppComponent {  
      public version: string = version;  
    }

It’s also possible to do step 2 in your environment.ts file, making the version info accessible from there.

# 34\. What are the generators in ES6?

One of the best question to check your ES6 skills. What is practical use if Generators?

Generator can be used to pause and resume multiple times.

The major use of this to handle the find scenarios where user hit find button again and again and if multiple search results available, user can move to different records one by one.

By default, generators are asynchronous.

# 35\. Explain the Error mechanism in your application.

All the application have their global error mechanism to handle the errors and log them on Splunk or new relic. Most of the team follow the global error mechanism which logs if any issues come for tracking purposes and redirect the users to specific routes.

**_Let’s checkout practical code to understand this concept better._**

## Expecting the Unexpected — Best practices for Error handling in Angular

### “To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.” — Oscar Wilde

# 36\. What is bootstrapping in angular?

Most of the time when this word comes to mind we think like a bootstrap library but no Bootstrapping is a technique of initializing or loading our Angular application.

Sometimes interviewers ask How angular application loads or explain angular application loading from the beginning. Let’s check the answer then.

**The Angular takes the following steps to load our first view.**

1.  Main.ts the application entry point
2.  Index.html loads
3.  Angular, Third-party libraries & Application loads
4.  App Module
5.  App Component
6.  app-root will add the component HTML inside

To know in detail see below.

# 37\. What are Angular elements? why we use it?

As Angular grows it comes with really good features. If you heard about microservices architecture to make applications more robust Angular is doing exactly the same.

With Angular Elements, we can plug and play angular applications to the other frontend frameworks.

> Let’s Continue with more questions.

# 38\. What is the difference between the arrow function and regular functions?

I have seen the interviewer started asking basic JavaScript questions to test the knowledge of candidates.

**Candidate:** I do know arrow functions have simpler syntax while regular functions have complex syntax.

The interviewer mostly understand how much deep water is :)

**Answer:**

**_1\. Argument Binding_** :

Arrow functions do not support an arguments binding while regular functions do have the support of argument binding ( However we can add arguments in arrow functions using spread operator)

**_2\. This keyword:_**

Arrow functions do not support this keyword while regular function has its own keyword support. This feature makes regular functions usage towards the factory method for object creation.

**_3\. New keyword:_**

Regular functions created using function declarations are construable and can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not construable, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.

**_4\. Duplicate Parameters:_**

Regular functions allowed duplicate parameters while Arrow functions don’t allow duplicate parameters.

# 39\. What is the difference between Functional vs Object Oriented Programming language? Which one you prefer and why?

I have seen a couple of interviewers started asking this kind of question to access candidate knowledge about the programming language they are currently working on.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*ZWb8LXXVXhS-TckktEAaQQ.png)
geeksforgeeks

The Advantages and Features of Functional programmings are:

-   **Pure functions**
-   **Function composition**
-   **Avoid shared state**
-   **Avoid mutating state**
-   **Provide Higher-Order Functions**

# 40\. What is the difference between JavaScript and TypeScript?

Candidate: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

I have seen most of the candidate’s answers plain as they don’t know many advantages of why angular uses the typescript.

You can find the best explanation here.

[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-typescript-and-javascript/#:~:text=TypeScript%20is%20known%20as%20Object,JavaScript%20is%20a%20scripting%20language.&text=TypeScript%20gives%20support%20for%20modules,JavaScript%20does%20not%20have%20Interface](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-typescript-and-javascript/#:~:text=TypeScript%20is%20known%20as%20Object,JavaScript%20is%20a%20scripting%20language.&text=TypeScript%20gives%20support%20for%20modules,JavaScript%20does%20not%20have%20Interface).

**Advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript**

-   TypeScript always give compilation errors at run time due to this it is easier to fix the issue before deployments
-   TypeScript supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time.
