# What is the wild card route?

One of the common use wild card route redirects to this route if someone types something which is not the proper path.

If the requested route URL does not belong to what’s mentioned in the code, we get an error in the console.

So to avoid this error, and instead tell the user that the route doesn’t exist, we use **WILDCARD ROUTES.**

Example:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:604/1*fxCE1xQ5qrMyQ0g-0C4Fjw.png)

**_Let’s check out some practical code to understand this concept better._**

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-feature-modules-final-and-wildcard-route-example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-feature-modules-final-and-wildcard-route-example)

# What is the difference between ngIf and hidden?

Isn’t it both same? both have the same function of hiding the things.No, but if you check that ngIf won’t load template if conditions get false while hidden will load the template and hide it.

**ngIf** will comment on the data if the expression is false. This way the data are not even loaded, causing HTML to load faster.

**\[hidden\]** will load the data and mark them with the _hidden_ HTML attribute. This way data are loaded even if they are not visible.

So _\[hidden\]_ is better used when we want the show/hide status to change frequently, for example on a button click event, so we do not have to load the data every time the button is clicked, just changing its _hidden_ attribute would be enough.

# What is a router outlet?

We do see this tag in the main app component HTML. But what is it? Let’s understand this term.

The router-outlet is a directive that’s available from the `@angular/router` package and is used by the router to mark wherein a template, a matched component should be inserted.

Thanks to the router outlet, your app will have multiple views/pages and the app template acts as a shell of your application. Any element, you add to the shell will be rendered in each view, only the part marked by the router outlet will be changed between views.

# What is the Router state?

As the term defined router state maintains the state of the routes and can be accessed by subscribing to specific route events.

_Let’s understand in a detailed manner._

RouterState and ActivatedRoute are similar to their snapshot counterparts except that they expose all the values as observables, which are great for dealing with values changing over time.

**Any component instantiated by the router can inject its ActivatedRoute.**

If we navigate from “/inbox/33/messages/44” to “/inbox/33/messages/45”, the data observable will emit a new set of data with the new message object, and the component will display Message 45.

## Accessing Snapshots

The router exposes parameters and data as observables, which is convenient most of the time, but not always. Sometimes what we want is a snapshot of the state that we can examine at once.

**_Let’s check out some practical code to understand this concept better._**

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-routerlink-state](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-routerlink-state)

# What is an Active route?

**ActivatedRoute provides access to the URL, params, data, queryParams, and fragment observables.**

**URL changes are the source of any changes in a route.** And it has to be this way as the user has the ability to modify the location directly.

**Any time the URL changes, the router derives a new set of parameters from it**: the router takes the positional parameters (e.g., ‘: id’) of the matched URL segments and the matrix parameters of the last matched URL segment and combines those. This operation is pure: the URL has to change for the parameters to change. Or in other words, the same URL will always result in the same set of parameters.

**Next, the router invokes the route’s data resolvers and combines the result with the provided static data.**

Given the following:

And navigating first to “/inbox/33/data/44” and then to “/inbox/33/data/45”, we will see:

url \[{path: ‘data’, params: {}}, {path: ‘44’, params: {}}\]  
url \[{path: ‘data’, params: {}}, {path: ‘45’, params: {}}\]

# Explain different injections in Angular.

One of the common interview questions asked in Angular interview questions is how you are using injections in Angular application?

There are 5 different ways we Angular provide dependency injections

1.  **use class**
2.  **use value**
3.  **use factory**
4.  **token factory**
5.  **component injections**

To know more in detailed implementations, Please check the below article.

## What can you provide with Dependency Injection in Angular?

# What is the best way to implement translations in Angular?

In the Single Page Application, One of the main features is multi-language support on the fly. But Sometimes the interviewer asks have you implemented translations in your application?

The most common library used for this is ngx-translate which provides a translation by adding in the JSON.

**_Let’s check out some practical code to understand this concept better._**

# Explain different routing params in Angular.

We do use routing parameters to maintain the data or sometimes pass data when navigating from one route to another route.

Angular does support the following routing parameters.

1.  Required Parameters
2.  Optional Parameters
3.  Query Parameters
4.  NavigationExtras

To learn more detail about routing params please check the following article.

# What is a virtual scroll in Angular?

Here Interviewer wants to check if you have updated knowledge of the latest Angular features.

The central concept behind virtual rendering is rendering only visible items.

For example, if there are thousands of alerts in an application, an efficient way would be to load only the elements that are visible and unload them when they are not by replacing them with new ones.

An initial implementation of virtual scrolling is now available in @angular/cdk. (v7.0.0-beta.0)

**_Let’s check out some practical code to understand this concept better._**

# What is the difference between route param vs query param?

The key difference between query parameters and [route parameters](/routing/routeparams) is that the route parameter is essential to determining the route, whereas query parameters are optional.

Let’s understand some of the basics of Routing in Angular.

## Declaring Route Parameters

The route for the component that displays the details for a specific product would need a route parameter for the ID of that product. We could implement this using the following `Routes`:

export const routes: Routes = \[

{ path: '', redirectTo: 'data', pathMatch: 'full' },

{ path: 'data', component: DataList },

{ path: 'data/:id', component: DataDetails }

\];

Note `:id` in the path of the `product-details` the route, which places the parameter in the path. For example, to see the product details page for a product with ID 5, you must use the following URL: `localhost:3000/product-details/5`

## Passing Query Parameters

Use the `[queryParams]` directive along with `[routerLink]` to pass query parameters. For example:

<a \[routerLink\]="\['data-list'\]" \[queryParams\]="{ page: 99 }"\>Go to Page 99</a\>

Alternatively, we can navigate programmatically using the `Router` service:

goToPage(pageNum) {  
this.router.navigate(\['/data-list'\], { queryParams: { page: pageNum } });  
}
