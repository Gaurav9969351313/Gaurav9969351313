If you’re practicing frontend interviews in leading tech companies or MNCs, chances are you’ve already understood that it’s not all about UI building anymore. Companies want you to show how well you understand JavaScript, systems thinking, and problem-solving capabilities that mirror real-world development.

Here’s a handpicked list of **frontend interview questions** that you need to know — based on real interviews — and what you’re actually supposed to know.

# 🧠 JavaScript Fundamentals

These are the bread and butter of any frontend interview. Be prepared to be asked not only what things are, but why they work the way they do.

-   **Closures**: Define closures by coding `createCounter()`. Interviewers love this because it tests understanding of scope.
-   **Memoization**: Code a `memoize()` function that stores expensive function calls. Perfect for optimization questions.
-   **Polyfills**: Recreate`Array.prototype.map`, `reduce`, and `Function.prototype.bind` from scratch. This demonstrates your in-depth knowledge of how JavaScript works under the hood.
-   **Async Handling**: Write `fetchWithRetry()` to handle flaky APIs elegantly. Bonus points if you add exponential backoff.
-   **Custom Promise.all**: Write a `promiseAll()` function to manage multiple asynchronous tasks — a great challenge for Promise handling.
-   **Debounce**: Write a `debounce()` function to optimize high-frequency events like `onInput` or `onScroll`.
-   **Event Loop Deep Dive**: Be ready to describe the output of async JavaScript puzzles involving `setTimeout`, `Promise`, and microtasks.

# 📚 Arrays: Think Beyond the Basics

These are not just DSA problems — they challenge your skill at writing efficient code under time constraints.

-   **Rotate by K**: Rotate an array left or right by _k_ positions — classic pointer manipulation.
-   **Max Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)**: Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray — a frequent question in both product and service-based companies.
-   **Two-Pointer Pattern**: Solve pair-sum problems efficiently. A must-know technique.
-   **Sort 0s, 1s, 2s**: Use the Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort with O(1) space.
-   **Sliding Window**: Find the longest substring without repeating characters — this one shows up everywhere.
-   **Fixed Window Sum**: Get the maximum sum of a fixed-size subarray — excellent to demonstrate time complexity thought.

# 🔤 Strings: Demonstrate You Can Manipulate Text Effectively

String problems usually have covert edge cases. These challenge your accuracy and string-pulling ability.

-   **Anagram Check**: Check Weather two strings are anagrams using sorting or frequency maps.
-   **First Unique Character**: Get the first non-duplicate character — excellent use case for hash maps.
-   **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Apply expand-around-center or dynamic programming methods.
-   **Rearranged Palindrome**: Verify whether characters can be rearranged to create a palindrome — unexpectedly frequent in interviews.

# 🧩 Objects: Master Core JavaScript Structures

Modern JavaScript is object manipulation-intensive. Be prepared to show these:

-   **Deep Clone**: Recursively clone nested objects. Bonus points if you deal with edge cases such as circular references.
-   **Flatten Object**: Transform deeply nested objects into a flat map with dot notation for keys.
-   **Frequency Counters**: Apply object maps to count frequencies of elements — a versatile method for most problems.

# 💡 Real-World Scenarios: Beyond Just Algorithms

These demonstrate you can code something that’s useful and scalable.

-   **Pagination Logic**: Take a page number and size as input and divide an array into paginated segments.
-   **Debounce in UI**: Apply debounce to a real UI element (such as a search input).
-   **Throttle API Calls**: Throttle rapid-fire API calls with a throttle function — a must-have for production-ready code.

# 🛠 Advanced Concepts & Systems Thinking

Senior or mid-level positions are within reach if these distinguish you from the pack.

-   **DOM Tree Serialization**: Serialize a DOM structure into JSON and deserialize from JSON back into a DOM structure — exemplifies recursion and knowledge of the DOM.
-   **Event Delegation**: Handle events on dynamic elements effectively with low memory overhead.
-   **LRU Cache**: Write Least Recently Used cache using a Map — commonly asked in system design interviews.
-   **Custom Promise Class**: Recreate a basic `Promise` class with `.then`, `.catch`, `.resolve` — tests deep knowledge of async flows.
-   **Dependency Graph Resolution**: Model how bundlers (such as Webpack) resolve dependencies in a directed graph.

# 🎯 Interview Tips That Actually Work

1.  **Walk through your thought process** before you write code — communication is more important than you realize.
2.  **Handle edge cases upfront** — it reflects maturity and experience.
3.  **Write clean, modular code** — even during interviews, readability trumps smart tricks.

# 🚀 Final Words

**Preparation > Luck**. Success in interviews isn’t only a matter of cracking problems — it’s showing consideration, coherence, and a capacity to evolve. Apply this guide to improve your skills and face interviews confidently.
