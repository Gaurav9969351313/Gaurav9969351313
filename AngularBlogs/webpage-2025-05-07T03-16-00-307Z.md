Recently, I was trying to prepare myself for upcoming interviews and it was a bit difficult to search in Google and open the links only to see the same questions each and every time. So, I thought of sharing what I have found and what are the most common questions someone should know if they are preparing for an interview.

Below are the most common interview questions asked in the latest Angular interviews. These Angular interview questions and answers help to prepare Angular developers for interviews ranging from junior to senior levels. Moreover, this article covers the basics to advance Angular interview questions which you must prepare in 2021.

# 1\. What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

The most common question which comes to every interviewer's mind is what is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit? Which one to use and why?

We mostly go with the answer that we do write the dependencies in the constructors while we write logics in the ngOninit.

Sometimes the interviewer will check what else we know about it? why we cannot put the services or logic in constructors?

The simple answer is sometimes we need to wait until all dependencies get loaded or for parent/child components we might need to wait until the component is loaded that’s why it’s preferable to write the logic in ngOnInit.

**Let’s check other differences.**

**_Let’s check out practical code to understand this concept better._**

# 2\. What is the difference between components and directives?

When this question comes to me I think I declare the directive the same as the component in the modules but what can be the major difference between these two?

Directive: don't have their shadow DOM, use to manipulate the behavior of the HTML elements

Component: have their own HTML, mostly used to break application based on feature

**Let’s check other differences.**

# 3\. What is the difference between ElementRef, TemplateRef, and viewContainerRef?

These many References? where we use them all?

If I take interviews this can be my question. It helps interviewers to understand what you know about the dynamic views in Angular.

**Let’s check the difference between ElementRef, TemplateRef, and viewContainterRef with examples.**

# 4\. What is the difference between ng-content,ng-template, and ng-container?

Too many ng’s everywhere LOL.

As angular do have the support of their template, ng-template and ng-container some of the commonly used template directive.

**Let’s check out the difference between ng-content,ng-template, and ng-container with examples.**

# 5\. What is the difference between view-child and content-child?

Working with angular is the reusing the components and deal with parent-child component is one of the common tasks we do as Angular Developer.

How to access the child component from the parent component? These two terms are more useful to you when you want to access child components from the parents component.

**Let’s check the difference between view-child and content-child with the examples.**

# 6\. What is the difference between component view, host view, and embedded view?

Honestly, this question is only be asked if you are appearing for senior angular interviews.

**Let’s check the difference between component view, host-view, and embedded views with the examples.**

# 7\. What is the difference between debounce time and throttle time?

One common scenario in every application is to call service as user types. There is a lot of ways to achieve this results and RXJS do provide these two functions to achieve this.

**Let’s focus on the difference between them.**

# 8\. What is the difference between forEach and map?

I know this is a JavaScript interview question but worth mentioning here as anything can come to front-end interview questions.

Let’s check out the difference between forEach and map.

# 9\. What is the difference between ng-content and ng-templateoutlet?

When we deal with multiple templates it is better to write reusable logic in the template itself. Having knowledge of these two terms can boost your chance to crack the angular developer interviews.

# 10\. What is the difference between forchild vs forroot?

One of the topics which you should know because this is the base of the angular dependencies injection. I feel you can check this detailed article to understand about these two terms.
