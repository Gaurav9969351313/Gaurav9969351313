Have you noticed this too? While scrolling through LinkedIn, you’ve probably seen countless candidates with the “Open to Work” badge on their profiles for months. The number of these green-bordered profile pictures keeps growing every day.

If you are not a Medium member, you can click [here](/@recep_taylanhan/i-failed-this-javascript-question-922dfc862540?sk=e1e9eae2394379d6ddb652037689b487) for reading.

But have you ever wondered why?

Today, I will break down some key reasons behind this trend and share practical insights to help job seekers land a job faster.

One crucial thing to remember: You must understand and be able to explain everything you put on your resume. If you can’t, you will not pass the technical interviews.

## Why Is the Tech Market Very Slow?

Numbers don’t lie.COVID-19 was a turning point for the tech industry. Many new tech companies and startups emerged, leading to a rapid increase in job opportunities. Companies hired aggressively to keep up with demand.

However, this growth was unbalanced, and overhiring became a problem. Then, a global recession hit, and from 2022 onward, tech layoffs began. Thousands of professionals lost their jobs, including highly experienced individuals with strong backgrounds.

Now, companies have significantly changed their hiring process. In the past, one or two interviews were enough to get a job. Today, candidates go through three or four rounds. With so many skilled professionals in the market, companies are being more selective, trying to hire only the best.

As a result, the hiring process has slowed down, and to be honest, finding a job has become much harder. You can find more details about [Tech Layoff in my previous article.](https://taylanhanr.substack.com/p/why-tech-layoffs)

**Today, let’s focus on an important frontend interview question.**

Many candidates include statements like:

> _“Improved application performance by 30% through code refactoring, data reorganization, removing code duplication, and simplifying conditional expressions.”_

It sounds impressive on a resume, but the real question is — can they actually explain it like an expert in an interview?

If an interviewer asks: **“Which approach did you use to achieve this?”**

One of the best ways to explain this is by discussing **Tree Shaking** in JavaScript. Let’s explain what is actually Tree Shaking.

> Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code. It relies on the [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.It’s commonly used in modern bundlers like **Webpack, Rollup, and ESBuild** to optimize performance.

> In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers (e.g., [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)) to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

## Answer that Question Like an Expert

> _“I optimized the application’s performance by_ **_implementing Tree Shaking,_** _which helps eliminate unused code from the final JavaScript bundle._ **_This was particularly effective in reducing the bundle size and improving load times_**_. I analyzed the dependency tree using tools like_ **_Webpack_** _and ensured that only necessary modules were included in the production build. Additionally, I refactored the code by removing redundant functions, simplifying complex conditionals, and restructuring data processing to reduce unnecessary computations. These optimizations collectively improved the application’s performance by 30%.”_

Let’s make a simple example of using Tree Shaking with Webpack.

## Step 1: Basic Project Setup

1.  **Create a project folder and initialize npm**

First let’s create a directory, initialize npm, [install webpack locally](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/#local-installation), and install the `[webpack-cli](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli)` (the tool used to run webpack on the command line)

mkdir tree-shaking-example && cd tree-shaking-example  
npm init -y

2\. Install Webpack and Babel

npm install \--save-dev webpack webpack-cli babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env

The `[import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)` and `[export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)` statements have been standardized in [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/). They are supported in most of the browsers at this moment, however there are some browsers that don't recognize the new syntax. But don't worry, webpack does support them out of the box.

Behind the scenes, webpack actually “transpiles” the code so that older browsers can also run it. If you inspect `dist/main.js`, you might be able to see how webpack does this, it's quite ingenious! Besides `import` and `export`, webpack supports various other module syntaxes as well, see [Module API](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods) for more information.

Note that webpack will not alter any code other than `import` and `export` statements. If you are using other [**ES6 features**](http://es6-features.org/)**,** make sure to [use a transpiler](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/#transpiling) such as [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) via webpack's [loader system](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/).

## **Step 2: Create Sample JavaScript Files**

`math.js` (Utility File with Unused Code)

export function add(a, b) {  
  return a + b;  
}  
  
export function multiply(a, b) {  
  return a \* b;  
}  
  
// This function is never used in the project  
export function subtract(a, b) {  
  return a - b;  
}

`index.js` (Main File That Only Uses 'add' Function)

import { add } from "./math.js";  
  
console.log("Result:", add(5, 10));

## Step 3: Configure Webpack for Tree Shaking

Create a `webpack.config.js` File

const path = require("path");  
  
module.exports = {  
  mode: "production", // Enables tree shaking  
  entry: "./index.js",  
  output: {  
    filename: "bundle.js",  
    path: path.resolve(\_\_dirname, "dist"),  
  },  
  optimization: {  
    usedExports: true, // Enables Tree Shaking  
  },  
  module: {  
    rules: \[  
      {  
        test: /\\.js$/,  
        exclude: /node\_modules/,  
        use: {  
          loader: "babel-loader",  
          options: {  
            presets: \["@babel/preset-env"\],  
          },  
        },  
      },  
    \],  
  },  
};

## Step 4: Build and Observe Tree Shaking in Action

Run Webpack to bundle the project

npx webpack

> What Happens after running the webpack ?
> 
> Since `subtract()` is **never used**, Webpack **removes it** from the final `bundle.js`.
> 
> Only the `add()` function is included, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

## How Tree Shaking Works?

**\> ES6 Module Analysis**: Webpack scans your import/export statements.

**\> Dead Code Elimination**: It removes functions that are not used in the final bundle.

**\> Minification**: Additional optimization happens in **production mode**, shrinking the code further.

# Conclusion

After spending a lot of time optimizing your resume for ATS, passing phone screenings, and clearing HR interviews, you’ve finally reached the **technical interview stage**. At this point, **you must be fully prepared**.

Everything on your resume should have **a strong foundation**, and you need to give **clear and confident answers**. If you can’t explain what you wrote, all your hard work could go to waste.

But remember, **a rejection is not a failure**. Every interview helps you learn and prepare better for the next one. Think of each interview as a **step forward** toward your goal.

**Keep going, and success will come.**

**Good luck!**
